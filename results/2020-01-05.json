It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===In \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" (2003) the giant eagle that saves Frodo &amp; Samwise, as originally described in J.R.R. Tolkien's book (1955), was inspired by the pub in Oxford where Tolkien famously wrote much of the novels. The pub's plackard depicts a large eagle carrying a boy.===In Killing Hasselhoff (2017), guests at David Hasselhoff's party are shown next to a very large replica of Hasselhoff. The replica was made for some visual effects in The Spongebob Sqaurepants Movie (2004), which Hasselhoff choose to keep after being offered to by the crew when filming ended.===In Iron Man (2008) Obadiah tells Tony that the arc reactor is his 'ninth symphony.' In the classical music world, there is a belief that after a composer writes their ninth symphony they would die. He was implying that the arc reactor would be the last thing Tony created before Obadiah kills him.===In Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) inside Uncle Aaron's apartment, you see on the TV an episode of Community with Donald Glover in a Spider-man shirt. Donald Glover not only plays Miles Morales in the TV show Ultimate Spiderman, but also Aaron Davis AKA Uncle Aaron in Spiderman: Homecoming===In Blade Runner 2049 (2017), Niander Wallace's headquarters are made of wood, a rare and very expensive material in 2049, to emphasize how wealthy he is.===In Joker (2019), the ambulances of \"Gotham\" show Arthur's transformation into the Joker, mirroring his face and smile after this transformation. (before on left and after on right)===In ‚ÄúInterstellar‚Äù (2014), there are numerous scenes of corn fields. Combines are seen working throughout the movie but the corn hasn‚Äôt tasseled yet, meaning there isn‚Äôt a single kernel on any of those plants that are being harvested.===In Shutter Island (2010), Teddy Daniels and Bridget Kearns have wardens in their shots, while Chuck Aule doesnt. This is to hint that Teddy and Bridget are mental patients, while Chuck is not.===In Prestige (2006) When the character Alley (Andy Serkis) is introduced, he makes a reference to a magic trick in which one person guesses the item in a person's pocket. The same trick fooled Serkis' character Gollum in Hobbit: An Unexpexted journey (2012).===The only time we see Gollum standing fully erect is once he claims back The Ring. ROTK (2003)===In Avengers Endgame (2019) When the remaining avengers are about to go back in time, their fist bump pose resembles Tony Starks Arc Reactor (2008)===In Toy Story (1995) the TV in Sid‚Äôs house has a pair of pliers where the channel knob once was since they would regularly come off/break.===Small parallel from Man of Steel (2013) and Batman v Superman (2016).===In Mrs Doubtfire (1994). When the family is looking for Mrs. Doubfire's replacement, the last name they cross off their list of applicants is ‚ÄúPaula Dupre‚Äô ‚Äú. Dupre‚Äô was the film's associate producer.===In a deleted scene in \"Godzilla\" (2014), Ford Brody has a conversation with a Japanese immigration agent after arriving at the airport in Japan. The immigration agent is played by Akira Takarada, who played the main character in the original \"Godzilla\" (1954).===Dead Again (1991): The prison numbers on Roman's (played by Kenneth Branagh) uniform are \"25101415\" or \"25 October 1415‚Äù. This is the date of the Battle of Agincourt fought by Henry V‚Äîwhich was the movie Branagh directed and starred in just before this one; Henry V (1989).===In A League of Their Own (1992), the girls try out at a baseball stadium in Chicago. During the try-out montage, a banner can be seen saying ‚Äúsee program for alert instructions.‚Äù This is a reference to World War II air raid alerts, in which citizens had to be aware of signals in case of an attack.===In MASH (1970) After the Painless Pole decides to commit suicide, the camp holds a \"last supper\" for him mirroring Leonardo's famous painting===Den of Thieves (2018): When O'shea Jackson Jr's character is kidnapped by the sheriffs and is questioned he says \"I ain't tha one\" referencing his dads (ice cube) song \"I aint tha one\"===In ‚ÄúJurassic Park: The Lost World‚Äù (1997) Malcolm argues with Hammond about playing down the deaths of three people, even though four people died in the original film. This was because no one knew what happened to Dennis Nedry.===In The Road to El Dorado (2000) one of the warriors playing ball against Miguel and Tulio is chewing chicle, a natural tree gum. Both the Aztecs and Maya traditionally chewed chicle as a way to stave off hunger, freshen breath, and keep teeth clean.===in Joker (2019) Arthur's mother comments on Thomas Wayne gaining weight but fails to notice the build of muscle and weight of Arthur between two scenes. (Low quality image but still apparent)===Superman (1978): Gene Hackman, who plays Lex Luthor, didn‚Äôt want to shave off his hair for the role. Instead, he wore a variety of ‚Äúwigs‚Äù throughout the film (in reality, it was just his hair styled in different ways). Luthor‚Äôs ‚Äúbaldness‚Äù (a bald cap) is revealed at the end of the movie.===In \"The Dead Don't Die\" (2019) The chairs in the detention centre are shaped like headstones.===In 2019's JOKER during the scene when Arthur and Penny are dancing there is a television on in the background that list \"Writen By\" credits as they scroll down. The names Ben Gattolari, Will Limpert, Nick Hexner, Eric Ward and Michael Auszura are all actual members of the JOKER film crew.",

They do NOT flap their wings‚Äîthey rotate them in a figure 8.===Peregrine Falcons are often quoted as being the fastest birds in the world, but can only actually achieve those insane speeds when diving. Many much, much larger birds, such as the golden eagle or the steppe eagle (pictured) can outpace a peregrine in a purely horizontal flight.===Giant Otter's, also known as Giant River Otter of the Amazon are known to live in stable family groups, Group sizes are anywhere from two to 20 members, but likely average between three and eight===A bad rap! Opossums rarely get rabies. Best guess is the sensitive nature of viruses and their lower than most body temperature. https://opossumsocietyus.org/faq-opossum/===An owls eyes are so big if we had the same size proportion we‚Äôd have softball sized eyes. A special ridge of bone supports them but it means they lack muscle to move their eyes. So they developed the ability to turn their head approximately 270 degrees to make up for this.===Black Vultures are highly social birds with strong family bonds. Even after fledging, family groups of black vultures remain in close contact by feeding and roosting together, and they will aggressively chase off non-family members.===The highland cow of Scotland has an unusual double coat of hair. On the outside is the oily outer hair‚Äîthe longest of any cattle breed‚Äîcovering a downy undercoat. This makes them well suited to conditions in the Highlands, which have a high annual rainfall and sometimes very strong winds.===An adult North American porcupine has about 30,000 quills that cover almost all of its body. The quills are hollow and used primarily for defense, but also serve to insulate their bodies during winter.===As soon as baby Komodo Dragons hatch, they will run away and climb up trees to avoid being eaten by their mother or other Komodos. When they are 4 years old and around 4 feet (1.2 m), the young Komodos will come down and live on the ground.===The Superb Bird of Paradise is a species of bird that lives in rainforests. The males have extremely black feathers which can absorb 99.95% of light. This is actually because the structure of the feathers is different, not the colouring.===Pseudocheirus occidentalis, the ringtail possum (shown here) only acts somewhat similarly to its distant relative, Didelphis virginiana, Virginia opossum (being native to eastern and southern North America). Rinngtail possum live in Australia and are closer related to kangaroos.===The African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) is not closely related to the African bush elephant; genetic studies suggest that its closer relatives were the extinct Eurasian straight-tusked elephants, called Paleoloxodon antiquus - which would invalidate both genera as we know them.===The avian magnetic compass of the robin uses vision-based magnetoreception, where its ability to sense the magnetic field of the earth for navigation is affected by light entering its eyes. This physical mechanism is not fully understood, but may involve quantum entanglement of electron spins.===All of the wingless ants you ever see are female. The male's life is but a blip- only used for mating, and he dies within minutes once the deed is done. All that prospers are empires of women in the ant universe.===Dingoes can range in color from golden, tan, and ginger, to black and cream. These colours are found among pure dingoes, but can vary more when interbreeding with dogs takes place. And their coats don‚Äôt produce the typical ‚Äúdog smell.‚Äù===Horned lizards not only have tough skin and sharp plates around their neck to stop them from becoming coyote snacks. They also have the amazing ability to deter predators by squirting blood from their eyes into an attacking predator‚Äôs face.===The common hippopotamus can reach upwards of 3,000 kg, whereas the diminutive pygmy hippopotamus rarely tops 300 kg. The hippos are so distinct that the species are two different genera.",
