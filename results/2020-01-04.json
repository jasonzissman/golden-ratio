      "aggregatedTitles": "===The Pied Wagtail is predominately a bird of the British Isles. It is pied and wags its tail a lot. It has an unusual number of regional names; in my native Hampshire and the south they're called Polly Dishwashers, elsewhere they may be Penny Wagtails, Willy Wagtails, Water Wagtails, and more.===The Sand Cat's outer ear is similar to that of a domestic cat, but its ear canal is about twice the size. Its hearing sensitivity is about 8 decibels greater.===Ring-tailed lemurs love to sunbathe, and do this sitting upright with their arms out sideways in order to warm up at the start of the day.===Valonia ventricosa, aka bubble algae, is the largest single-celled organism on earth!===The term \"peacock\" is commonly used to refer to birds of both sexes. Technically, only males are peacocks. Females are peahens, and together, they are called peafowl.===Hummingbirds beat their wings as fast as 80 times per second. They do NOT flap their wings—they rotate them in a figure 8.===Peregrine Falcons are often quoted as being the fastest birds in the world, but can only actually achieve those insane speeds when diving. Many much, much larger birds, such as the golden eagle or the steppe eagle (pictured) can outpace a peregrine in a purely horizontal flight.===Giant Otter's, also known as Giant River Otter of the Amazon are known to live in stable family groups, Group sizes are anywhere from two to 20 members, but likely average between three and eight===A bad rap! Opossums rarely get rabies. Best guess is the sensitive nature of viruses and their lower than most body temperature. https://opossumsocietyus.org/faq-opossum/===An owls eyes are so big if we had the same size proportion we’d have softball sized eyes. A special ridge of bone supports them but it means they lack muscle to move their eyes. So they developed the ability to turn their head approximately 270 degrees to make up for this.===Black Vultures are highly social birds with strong family bonds. Even after fledging, family groups of black vultures remain in close contact by feeding and roosting together, and they will aggressively chase off non-family members.===The highland cow of Scotland has an unusual double coat of hair. On the outside is the oily outer hair—the longest of any cattle breed—covering a downy undercoat. This makes them well suited to conditions in the Highlands, which have a high annual rainfall and sometimes very strong winds.===An adult North American porcupine has about 30,000 quills that cover almost all of its body. The quills are hollow and used primarily for defense, but also serve to insulate their bodies during winter.===As soon as baby Komodo Dragons hatch, they will run away and climb up trees to avoid being eaten by their mother or other Komodos. When they are 4 years old and around 4 feet (1.2 m), the young Komodos will come down and live on the ground.===The Superb Bird of Paradise is a species of bird that lives in rainforests. The males have extremely black feathers which can absorb 99.95% of light. This is actually because the structure of the feathers is different, not the colouring.===Pseudocheirus occidentalis, the ringtail possum (shown here) only acts somewhat similarly to its distant relative, Didelphis virginiana, Virginia opossum (being native to eastern and southern North America). Rinngtail possum live in Australia and are closer related to kangaroos.===The African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) is not closely related to the African bush elephant; genetic studies suggest that its closer relatives were the extinct Eurasian straight-tusked elephants, called Paleoloxodon antiquus - which would invalidate both genera as we know them.===The avian magnetic compass of the robin uses vision-based magnetoreception, where its ability to sense the magnetic field of the earth for navigation is affected by light entering its eyes. This physical mechanism is not fully understood, but may involve quantum entanglement of electron spins.===All of the wingless ants you ever see are female. The male's life is but a blip- only used for mating, and he dies within minutes once the deed is done. All that prospers are empires of women in the ant universe.===Dingoes can range in color from golden, tan, and ginger, to black and cream. These colours are found among pure dingoes, but can vary more when interbreeding with dogs takes place. And their coats don’t produce the typical “dog smell.”===Horned lizards not only have tough skin and sharp plates around their neck to stop them from becoming coyote snacks. They also have the amazing ability to deter predators by squirting blood from their eyes into an attacking predator’s face.===The common hippopotamus can reach upwards of 3,000 kg, whereas the diminutive pygmy hippopotamus rarely tops 300 kg. The hippos are so distinct that the species are two different genera.===White tailed shrew mothers are known to form \"tail trains\" to lead their babies along more easily===Blue tongued skinks can get up to almost 600mm and can often be found in and around gardens. But they are more beneficial than harmful as they are not venomous and eat common garden pests such as snails. https://australianmuseum.net.au/learn/animals/reptiles/eastern-blue-tongue-lizard/===The Olm is a cave-dwelling salamander. It is estimated that they have a maximum lifespan of over 100 years and they can survive 10 years without food due to their low metabolism.",
