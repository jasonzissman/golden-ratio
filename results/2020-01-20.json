The first time was enough.===LPT: pay attention to the end of prices while shopping at Costco===LPT: If you want to develop more friendships (especially if you don't have many or are an introvert that doesn't get out on your own), then don't say no when someone you're interested in becoming friends with invites you out. They put themselves out there to invite you and might not again.===LPT: Walk opposite of car traffic if the street you‚Äôre walking on does not have sidewalks.===LPT: if you are watching a presentation or a lecture on Youtube or Udemy, try adjusting the playback rate to watch it 1,5x or 1,75x than the normal speed. It's usually just as easy to understand but you'll be done 60-70% faster!===LPT: Today is an ideal day to visit your \"saved\" section.===LPT: If your goal in life is to be useful to others, you can start by figuring out how to be useful to yourself.===LPT: Don't give up your right of way (as a driver or a pedestrian)===LPT: If you use Outlook desktop to manage email add a one minute delay to every email you send. It is always half a second later you hit send that you realize that you forgot to add something. You can then go to outgoing mail and find it waiting for you===LPT: when you are shopping for insurance online, use an app that gives you a phone number instead of using your own phone number. You will get many spam calls, you can always get a fresh number when you find the quote you are looking for, then make sure you change it to your real number.===LPT: Avoid a scam. There is never a need to send a Google verification code to someone else.===LPT: Check in on your friend‚Äôs mental health. Keep asking how they‚Äôre doing. Some people don‚Äôt want to bother others with their problems, but they desperately want someone to talk to.===LPT If you believe someone else screwed up or is simply clueless, still treat them with respect. In my experience, odds are about even that you are the one who has erred. You'll end up eating a lot less crow.===LPT - want VIP treatment at a busy bar?===LPT: If a service dog approaches you without their owner, they need your help!===LPT: Make your bed every morning===LPT to first time parents. If you're nervous about if you're going to be a good parent, just be there for him/her and always return home. Both my wife and I had parents that abandoned us, you don't know the value of a parent that's just there.===LPT: When searching for new homes (apartments, houses, or whatever), you can call the utility providers that service that address and get averages and totals for the previous year or two.===LPT: If you're planning a big life event (wedding, baby, graduation, etc.) create an email account specifically for that event. That way you can register and shop online and avoid reminder and promotional emails being sent to your daily use email after the event has ended.===LPT : When you can, change \"I have to\" to \"I get to\", to help be more mindful and thankful.===LPT: When registering for online services, enter Germany or other EU countries as your location to get better privacy features by default because of GDPR.===LPT: If you‚Äôre having a hard time spreading jelly jam on toast, try using a fork.===LPT: When you have a cold or are sick, try not to stay sedentary for long. Taking a small walk every hour or two can help minimize effects of a cold.===LPT: If you have an iPhone, make sure you have Find My iPhone enabled and have emergency contacts listed in your Medical ID.===LPT: Never give in to bitterness; it's like paying a toll to go down a dead end road.===LPT: Register to become a stem cell donor",
