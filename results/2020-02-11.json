He was so convincing that surviving members of The Doors mistook Kilmer‚Äôs singing for Morrison‚Äôs. To prepare, he learned 50 songs and spent a year as Jim. He actually had to go to therapy to get out of character.===In Parasite (2019) literal lines are used throughout the movie noting whether if a character ‚Äòcrossed the line‚Äô or not.===In Fight Club (1999) there are many hints pointing towards the twist of the movie, one of them beeing that when they get on the bus, only one of them pays for the ticket===At the end of Captain America: Civil War (2016), Vision is seen contemplating the role he played in the ‚Äúcatastrophe‚Äù he had predicted. He is holding a Rook, the only chess piece that represents a thing instead of a person.===In one scene in Sky High (2005), an announcement says that sidekicks cannot eat the school‚Äôs hero sandwiches. Once Will is made from a sidekick to a hero, he is shown eating a hero sandwich for lunch.===In Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), two apples and a banana are strategically placed on Lt. Lois Einhorn's desk, foreshadowing the fact that she was born with a penis.===In one scene in Sky High (2005), Layla Williams (Danielle Panabaker) tells Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano) that she cannot grow lemons using her Chlorokinesis. Lemons are famously not a natural fruit: they were a breed between citron and bitter orange originating in Assam.===When Taxi Driver (1976) initially received an X-Rating due to the graphic violence of the final shootout. To attain an R-Rating, Martin Scorsese had the colors de-saturated, making the brightly colored blood less prominent, a change he considered a big improvement on what was originally shot===Knives Out (2019) had many closeups of characters with eyeglasses, so the production cleverly sculpted mattes to reshape lighting equipment into scenery you'd realistically expect to see reflected in the glasses.===At the end of Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), when a train passes through Toontown, each window shows a different murder or death taking place (if viewed frame-by-frame===Big Hero 6 (2014) Hans, the conniving antagonist from Frozen, makes a cameo as a statue in Disney‚Äôs Big Hero 6.===In toy story 4 (2019) a laugh canister from Monster's can be seen in the antique shop.===In Jo Jo Rabbit (2019) after the second encounter with the Jew girl Hilter says, \"She's pretty rude you know. That's just my two pfennige.\" A fpennige was official German currency from the 9th century until the Euro was adapted in 2002.===In Olympus Has Fallen (2013), Speaker of the House Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) says ‚ÄúOkay Mike, You‚Äôve got 30 Minutes‚Äù when there are exactly 30 minutes of the movie remaining.===Avengers CW (2016): To reinforce the idea of Cap being out of place in a modern world, on his high-tech HQ desk he still has a fountain pen and ink bottle.===In Knives Out (2019), the portrait of the deceased has a subtle change after the murder has been solved... a smirk.===In Jurassic Park: The Lost World (1997) During the San Diego T-rex rampage scene, a group of men yelled in Japanese \"I left Japan to get away from this!\" as and obvious reference to the Godzilla franchise. (Roughly 40-46 seconds into the clip)===In Joker (2019) the Jokers costume colours and make up matches perfectly with the curtains on Murray's show.===In the movie Parasite (2019), the noodle dish that Chung-sook makes is actually made using two different packets of instant noodles and is a popular, cheap dish in South Korea. She doctors it up with high-quality steak to make it seem more high-brow for Yeon-kyo.===In Die Hard (1988), the truck used to transport the terrorists was made bigger in later scenes because the decision to use an Ambulance as escape wasn't decided until well into shooting. It's evidenced at the beginning of the film when the team exit the back of the truck and no ambulance is seen===In Cry-Baby (1990), Willem Dafoe improvised the moment when he slaps Johnny Depp's ass.===In La La Land (2016) Mia is never seen drinking alcohol because her aunt was an alcoholic who ‚Äúlived in her liquor‚Äù===In Ocean's Twelve (2004) the character Tess, played by Julia Roberts, is forced to pretend to be Julia Roberts and has to act like Roberts to Roberts' friends. In the credits, the character Tess is credited for her portrayal.===DreamWorks' Abominable (2019) has a scene featuring a map showing China's \"nine-dash line\" in the South China Sea.

He died due to neglect.===The grebes' leg movements are extremely fast. They take as many as 10 strides per second, which is faster than any other bird ever studied. They can run on water.===Unlike most reptiles, female alligators are actually very good and protective mothers. An alligator that is ready to lay eggs builds a large nest using mud, sticks and plants. She will lay 10-50 eggs on top of this nest and then cover them with more material. The decomposing plants warm the nest.===The Dumbo octopus acquired its adorable name from its resemblance to the title character of Disney's 1941 film Dumbo because of the octopus' prominent ear-like fins which extend from the mantle above each eye.

Remoras get a free ride and protection, thus saving them valuable energy. The remora is doing its host a huge service by hoovering up parasites.===Although hyenas may look like canines to many, they are actually classified in their own family that isn‚Äôt canid or felid, called Hyaenidae. However, being members of Feliformia, they are more closely related to cats than dogs. Instead of a pup, the young hyena pictured here is called a cub.===Incubator birds are Australian fowl that are quite unique - while all other birds use their body heat to incubate their eggs, incubator birds pile plant debris on their eggs and make use of the heat of composting to hatch their eggs. The bird periodically monitors the temperature of the mound.===The bearded reedling (Panurus biarmicus) is a small roundish bird native to Europe and Asia with the single largest population of around 500 nesting pairs residing in the marshy reed beds along the Tay River in Great Britain where they stay year round.===The Eurasian sparrowhawk is migratory in the north of its range, with these birds wintering in southern Europe, southern Asia and less commonly in Africa.===The red-crested turaco (Tauraco erythrolophus), the national bird of Angola, is one of the more colorful birds in its genus, and its call sounds somewhat like a jungle monkey. Turacos are found in large flocks and feed on ripe fruits. Interestingly, all flock members help new moms with \"childcare.\"===Southern Flying Squirrels can rotate up to 180 degrees mid-flight. They can manipulate their \"wings\" depending on if they want to travel quickly/ long distances or simply \"parachute\" down. parts of their gliding seemingly defy physics. They may also use echolocation and they glow pink in blacklight.===This is the Ili pika, an endangered animal native to Northwestern China. It has only been seen a few times, and there are estimated to be less of 1000 of them left.===The thorn treehopper (Alchisme grossa) is one of the most attentive of all insect parents. She will fiercely defend her offspring until they are fully grown using her thorn-shaped headdress as a shield and intimidation tool. This insect is found in abundance in the rain cloud forests of Bolivia.===Clownfish like Nemo are in the family Anemonefish that includes about thirty other species. When the lone female in a group of Anemonefish dies, the biggest male (the only one that was breeding) becomes a female and resumes reproduction - now with the new largest male.===The cougar (Puma concolor) is native to the Americas and has the widest range of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere which accounts for all its other names: puma, mountain lion, red tiger and catamount. Its range extends from Canada to the southern regions of South America.===The muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), the only species in genus Ondatra, is a medium-sized semi-aquatic rodent native to North America and is found in wetlands over a wide range of climates and habitats. Muskrats mate while underwater and can also hold their breaths for up to 20 minutes underwater.===The point colouration typical of Siamese cats is a form of partial albinism and is caused by an enzyme involved with producing colour pigment that is heat sensitive and only functions in a cool environment.

Interestingly, the hoopoe flies more like a butterfly than a bird with its rounded wings closing only halfway in flight. It is the national bird of Israel.===The Cuban tody (Todus multicolor) is a bird species in the family Todidae that is found in Cuba and adjacent islands. This species nests in holes burrowed in clay embankments, occasionally in a rotten tree trunk or even at the entrance to limestone caves. They are most often seen in pairs.",
