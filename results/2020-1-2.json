This helps to ensure that your bed is warm for your return.===LPT: if your high school GPA and extracurriculars aren't up to par for the university you're interested in, attend community college for two years and save some money whilst boosting up your stats.===LPT: If you're traveling abroad, take a photo of your passport and send it to your own email address. If your passport gets lost or stolen, it's much easier to get back home if you have readily available proof of citizenship.===LPT: Have to change work passwords often? Use motivational phrases, eg: bemoreassertiveinmeetings or gettowork10minutesearly - not only does typing it out mentally reinforce the mantra, but you can write it on a sticky note just incase and nobody will know it's a password.===LPT: You can always say ‚ÄúNice to see you‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúNice to meet you‚Äù. If you‚Äôre meeting the person for the first time, it‚Äôs still a nice sentiment, but if you aren‚Äôt meeting the person for the first time, you don‚Äôt risk offending them by forgetting.===LPT: Do not try to start small talk with someone who has headphones in. They so clearly do not want to be bothered in that moment.===LPT: Unless it's specifically asked for, or you're willing to accept the bulk of the responsibility, be cautious gifting someone a pet or plant. They can be a huge responsibility, and the recipient may not be willing to have that responsibility.===LPT: If you use a Christmas bonus to pay off a debt with accruing interest, you have increased the overall worth of the bonus.===LPT: The dog park is a great place to work on your social skills===LPT: Adding the word ‚Äúdebunked‚Äù or ‚Äúskeptic‚Äù to the end of any google search will give you different, and often more accurate, information. Do this any time you read a questionable claim, conspiracy theory, or just want more information.===LPT: Every time you talk to someone, regardless of how long you've known them, try to learn something new about them. This will train you to be a better listener and to ask open ended questions with greater frequency.===LPT: If you ever read a newspaper or a source and recognize something as blatantly wrong- ask yourself if you take everything else in that same medium as the truth===LPT: Take photos of heart-felt messages you write in cards this holiday season. People tend to respond to any kind words without providing context and it can be hard to remember what specifically you wrote.===LPT: Don't beat yourself for being awkward. Other people often see a little awkwardness as endearing===LPT: Freeze your credit with all three credit bureaus. It's easy to do and you can also easily get a one-time pin when you need to sign up for loans et cetera. This will significantly improve your protection from identity theft.===LPT: Peak memory retention using multiple languages===LPT: Don't forget about the cool side of your pillow.===LPT : change your bedsheets on a Sunday. It will make the whole 'get up for another week procedure' a little bit easier.",

Research has proven that these elusive pescatarians genetically differ from timber wolves. (Source: National Geographic)===A cat has the power to sometimes heal themselves by purring. A domestic cat‚Äôs purr has a frequency of between 25 and 150 Hertz, which happens to be the frequency at which muscles and bones best grow and repair themselves.===The long-eared pika, a relative of rabbits found in the himalayas, lives at elevations of up to 20,000 feet (6,130 metres), making them one of the world's highest dwelling mammals.===Brookesia Micra is the world's smallest chameleon, reaching adult lengths of only 29mm/(1.1 inch). They are only found on one small island in Madagascar, and were discovered in 2012.===The Frillback pigeon is a selectively bred fancy pigeon bred for having curls on their wing shield feathers.===The Binturong, known as the 'bearcat', is neither a bear, nor a cat, but actually is more closely related to fossas. They have a muscular tail as long as their body, which they use both to grapple onto trees and communicate with other Binturongs. Their pee smells like freshly buttered popcorn.===The bee hummingbird is the smallest bird, weighing in at 0.056 ‚Äì 0.071 oz===The Bearded Vulture (Gypaetus Barbatus) is Europe's largest bird of prey, lives in the high mountains, looks badass and feeds almost exclusively on bones. Not marrow, bones. (Source: Wikipedia)===Paedophryne amauensis is not only the world's smallest frog, but also the world's smallest known vertibrate. Dwarfed by a dime, it measures only 7.7mm (0.30in) long.===The long beak of a toucan regulates heat distribution, acting as a thermal radiator of sorts.===The American Fantails is a breed of fancy pigeon selectively bred to have up to 40 tail feathers.===Matamatas are carnivorous bottom feeders with a unique predation method that involves \"vacuuming\" up small fish and invertebrates. They remain largely motionless and camouflaged in the muddy waters they inhabit, which allows them to ambush their prey.===The Rusty spotted cat is the worlds smallest cat weighing in at only 2.0-3.5 lb.===Lophosaurus dilophus, the crowned forest dragon or Indonesian forest dragon, is a large arboreal agamid lizard found in New Guinea and the Moluccan islands, Indonesia.===Tawny frogmouths form partnerships for life and usually stay in the same territory, establishing and maintaining physical contact is an integral part of their bonding process. Both parents share the duty of incubating their egg(s) as well as care for their young until they fledge.===The Tuatara is not a lizard, but actually the sole survivor of an order of reptiles dating back 200 million years ago. They are some of the slowest developing reptiles living today. Henry, Pictured, was still reproductively active at 111 years of age.===Bearded dragons are one of the most popular reptile pets due to their calm nature, but a little known fact about them is that they are actually venomous. Thankfully, their primitive venom, although related to rattlesnake toxins, is too weak to effect humans, but may be used to subdue their prey.===The New Mexican Whiptail is a species of lizard that is entirely female. They reproduce asexually, and lay eggs that will always result in female babies, which are genetic clones of the mother. Curiously, they still engage in ‚Äòmating behaviour‚Äô and courtship rituals with one another.===Kiwi are the only birds with external nostrils at the ends of their beaks. Their beaks are long and tipped with many sensor pits to detect worms and other invertebrates underground and in vegetation. Consequently, Kiwi can often be heard loudly snuffling and snorting to clear out their nostrils.===The corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus) is a North American species of rat snake that is named for the species' regular presence near grain stores, where it preys on mice and rats. They lack functional venom and help control populations of wild rodents that damage crops and spread disease.===The Portia Jumping Spider is remarkably intelligent, capable of problem solving and learning from experience. They can learn through trial and error to solve problems, and when hunting, can make detours to find the ‚Äòbest route‚Äô to their prey, and even respond to positive and negative reinforcement.===The Russian Desman is a large, semiaquatic mole. Like other moles, it is functionally blind and obtains much of its sensory input from the touch-sensitive Eimer's organs at the end of its long snout.===The stone marten. These mustelids are closely related to otters and weasels. They usually inhabit the hills and forests of Central Europe, but have made headlines across Europe for starting electrical fires and have caused 63 million euros of damage in Germany alone===Opossums have prehensile tails, allowing them to gather leaves and grass as they build their nests, as well as opposable \"thumbs\" called hallux on all four feet!",
