It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===In Starship Troopers (1997) the cast agreed to do the co-ed shower scene only if the director, Paul Verhoeven agreed to direct the scene naked, which he did.===Kid notices something that most of us wouldn't have: UP(2009), Cars 2 (2011)===I always wondered what would Mantis be doing with her 'put you to sleep' superpowers in Avengers Endgame (2019) final battle scene. In my 5th (or was it 8th) viewing, I spotted her putting the big dog to sleep in the middle of a pitched battle and moving on to her next target.===In Infinity War (2018) Cap's suit is slightly damaged revealing the 'scales' used in his outfit during Endgame (2019)===In Monsters Inc (2001), many doors feature multiple crossbars, presumably because of the dramatic size variation between some of the monsters===Disney's \"Lilo &amp; Stitch\" (2002) used watercolor backgrounds, exclusively. The studio had some financial failures and was doing ambitious things elsewhere, so they left the filmmakers to their own devices, off at the Florida studio. The only other watercolor films are Dumbo and Snow White.===In Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), the “perfect” Peter of Miles’ universe has a spotless name tag, while “hobo” Peter B.’s name tag is dirty and worn.===In None but the Lonely Heart (1944), Cary Grant plays a young teenaged ne’er-do-well, despite being literally 40 years old at the time the movie released!===Nick Park, creator of Wallace and Gromit (who first appeared in A Grand Day Out in 1989), modelled Wallace’s expressive face on his own. Wallace’s love of cheese is also down to the fact that Nick thought that ‘cheese’ was the most fun word to animate Wallace saying.===In Blazing Saddles (1974) when Mongo rides into town on his bull it has YES and NO on his backside. This is because back then tractor-trailers had one on each side to indicate the safe side to pass on (left) and the joke was that Mongo was as big as truck.===In JOKER (2019) Arthur's Make up starts from a close resemblance to John Wayne-Gacy's Pogo make up to something more distinctive as Arthur continues to descend into madness, on top of that, the Make Up uses pointed shapes, something real clowns frown upon hinting at why the others dislike Arthur.===In Madagascar (2005) one of the lemurs is named after the first king of Madagascar, Móric Beňovský. Móric was also the first european that sailed in the Pacific ocean===For everybody wondering which year is it in Joker (2019). Its probably the year 1981 because they showing the movies Zorro, The Gay Blade and the movie Blow Out which premiered both on july of 1981.===In Avengers: Endgame (2019), Ironman enters a building with his suit and the first thing to retract is his feet so that he could have a soft landing and be quieter===In the movie IT: Chapter Two (2019), the movie poster spells out IT in the scene where Richie goes to the movie theater.===In Spider-Man (2002) the scene in which Peter Parker catches Mary Jane's lunch on the tray involved no CGI. With the help of a sticky substance to keep the tray planted on his hand, eventually, after 156 takes, he performed the stunt exactly as seen.===In Jojo Rabbit (2019), Taika Waititi does a little nod to Danger 5 (2011) with Hitler’s swan dive out of a plate glass window===In Kung Fu Panda(2008), when Shi Fu steals a dumpling, he makes this face. The scene lasts for less than 30 frames.===In Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), the book says “Raputa” despite the title of the movie and other references in the movie saying “Laputa” — (this may be because there isn’t a distinction between R and L in Japanese).===I’m Ready Player One (2018), when Wade meets Aech and Daito in the real world(before they enter a van) there’s a graffiti of Rachel Roth aka RAVEN from DC Comics on the left. This art of Raven is specifically by Ed Benes.===The theater in Birdman (2014) has the same carpet pattern as the Overlook hotel from The Shining (1980).===In Stripes (1981), Sgt Hulka tells the platoon that tomorrow they're going to do 10 miles rain or shine. The next morning when he wakes them up he says 5 miles, but doubles it to 10 after Bill Murray protests.===Doctor Sleep (2019) - Tet Corporation is prevelant in several of Stephen King's books.===In Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers(2002) at the end of his meeting with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, Eomer's sword falls out of his scabbard as he mounts his horse===Toy Story (1995)",
