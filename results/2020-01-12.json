They also suck their trunk just as a human baby might suck its thumb.===[oc] Blue Iguanas are endangered and native to the island of Grand Cayman===Cat can actually speak in English/other language. A secret code of meows develops between cat and its owner, unique to that cat alone. So they are smart enough to imitate sound similar to their owner. This adorable creature can actually produce about 100 different vocalizations.===All three thresher shark species have been listed as vulnerable to extinction by the Worlds Conservation Union since 2007 (IUCN).
