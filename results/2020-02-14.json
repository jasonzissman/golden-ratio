Intriguing situation to watch, as he now has time to find his new team ahead of free agency.===[@FitzBeatSr] I’m told 🏈Las Vegas is prepared to offer @TomBrady $60 million over 2 years.===[Highlight] Josh Norman’s final defensive play as a Redskin: After WAS starting CB’s get hurt, Norman is put in late in the game, and immediately gets beat by Eagles college QB turned PS WR Greg Ward Jr. in the endzone, thus securing the 2nd overall pick for WAS. Thank you for your parting gift Josh===Fun Fact: Eric Fisher is the first #1 overall pick to win a Super Bowl with the team that drafted him since Peyton Manning.===[Benjamin] AJ Bouye, CB for the Jags, expected to be cut.===Joe Thomas gave up 30 sacks in his career. The Browns had 29 different players attempt a pass during that time.===[Marino] Josh Norman is bad. He's 32 and always had a bad athletic profile and it's been in steep decline since 2017. He's been cooked in coverage the last two seasons===[Rapoport] Sources: The #Ravens are releasing S Tony Jefferson, a starter for the last three seasons. He had a cap hit of almost $12M, and this saves the majority of it.===[PFT] Todd Haley hired as offensive coordinator at Sarasota high school===[GeoffSchwartz] Larry Allen bench pressing 700lbs without a bench shirt, barely any tape and no elbow sleeves is amazing. One of the best physical feats I’ve seen===[PFF] In his first 6 seasons in the NFL, Josh Norman surrendered just 13 TDs in coverage. Over the past 2 seasons he has allowed 16===Arthur Blank: I love Devonta Freeman, but we have to build a roster===[Garafolo] Another release by the #Redskins: WR Paul Richardson is being let go, source says. Just mentioned this possibility on @1067theFan and that quickly it’s happened.===[Rapoport] 49ers LB Kwon Alexander wasn’t just playing in the Super Bowl with a surgically repaired pec. Sources say he was also dealing with a biceps injury that is being surgically repaired today. He’ll have a full recovery for 2020, but amazing to think what he played through this year.===How Patrick Mahomes stacks up against NFL history===[Dery] Yesterday’s report claiming that the Lions were having trade talks involving Matthew Stafford was centered heavily around “what Kelly Stafford posted on Instagram.”===[Jamal Adams] I’m at dinner &amp; I promise I just busted out laughing... This cannot be real bro! 😂😭===[Ravens] Offensive lineman James Hurst has been suspended for the first four games of the 2020 regular season for violating the NFL policy on performance-enhancing substances.===[NFL Update] #Cardinals GM Steve Keim says the team has had contact extension talks with CB Patrick Peterson. He’s entering the final year of his deal. Keim also said that cutting RB David Johnson is not an option.===Mitch Trubisky ranks among worst starting quarterbacks of 2019===Myles Garrett again alleges Mason Rudolph called him a racial slur===[Rapoport] Cutting David Johnson is out. Trading would make sense if the Cardinals knew they were getting back Kenyan Drake (and if they’d eat some $$ to make it happen).===[Highlight] Deebo Samuel makes the juggling catch off the back of Kevin Peterson===[Rapoport] Some transactions: The #Texans released CB Vernon Hargreaves, the former first rounder, and the #49ers have cut DT Ethan Westbrook.===[Pauline] Also- as i reported from the Senior Bowl- word is the Redskins are expected to be suitors for Austin Hooper once FA kicks off.",

It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===Notice: As of 2/10/2020, we are requiring sources (in comments) for trivial details.===In Citizen Kane (1941), the audience that watches Kane make his speech is a still photo. To give the illusion of crowd movement, holes were pricked in with a pin, and lights moved around behind it.===In Inglorious Basterds (2009), Hans Lander subtly checks the pulse of the girl he is interrogating.===In Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) The sound clip used during cap lifting Mjolnir is the same that they played during cap jumping the bridge in his first movie.===In Rocky (1976), Rocky mentions to the promoter that the colors of his shorts are wrong. The actual colors are inverted, white shorts with a red stripe. The banner was accidentally made this way in real life and the dialogue regarding the color was added to compensate for the film’s low budget.===In Short Circuit (1986) and Short Circuit 2 (1988), Johnny 5’s creator, an Indian robotics expert, was played by a white actor in brown face===In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), Joel claims that he is incapable of making eye contact with a woman that he doesn't know. However when meeting Clementine again after having his memory of her erased he makes eyes contact showing that his memory of her wasn't completely gone.===In “Toy Story” (1995) the carpet in Sid’s hallway matches the carpet from the hallway in “The Shining,” (1980).===In Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980), concept designer Ralph McQuarrie makes a cameo with his sketchbook while rebels ready for battle===In Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), the license plate 'TASM 143' is a reference to The Amazing Spider-Man comic issue 143 in which Peter Parker and MJ also shared their first kiss.===In the beginning of 'Inside Llewyn Davis' (2013), the cat reads the steet names behind Llewyns back, which he remembers and uses to get back home by the end of the film.===In The Last Jedi (2017) the burning tree resembles the Rebel/Resistance's Phoenix symbol, while the dark side cave resembles the First Order insignia.===Tombstone 1993===A militia member can be seen casually flipping off the camera while being interviewed by Michael Moore in Bowling For Columbine (2002)===The paintings in Frozen (2013) are all based on real life art. Explanation in comments.===In Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), Finn's Stormtrooper Name Is the Same as Princess Leia's Cell in Star Wars: A New Hope===In Uncut Gems (2019), before the scene where Howard sells the opal to KG, he agrees to sell it for $175,000. During the scene itself KG subtly tells Howard it's $165,000 and when the casino counts the money in the bag it was actually $155,000. This can't be a coincidence in a movie about scamming.===During a fight scene in Fight Club (1999), you can see the narrator's head nod upward in the upper left corner, right as Tyler Durden is kicked in the face, subtly signaling their connection.===The blue ring Dr. Ellie Ann Arroway (Jodie Foster) was wearing in the film Contact (from the novel by Carl Sagan) represents the Pale Blue Dot (photo of the Earth taken from Voyager 1 on February 14, 1990, at the request of Carl Sagan).===Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) When Elizabeth retrieves the Aztec medallion from her drawer, a layer of dust is shown to have collected on the bottom surface, implying she has never taken it out since obtaining it from Will eight years prior.===In The Matrix (1999), the corporation Neo works for is called “Metacortex”. The roots of this word are meta- \"going beyond or higher, transcending,\" and -cortex, the outer layer of the brain. Thus, Metacortex is \"transcending the boundaries of the brain,\" which is what the plot centers around===In Jojo Rabbit (2019), Rosie's storyline was foreshadowed by herself (Further spoilery explanation in the comments)===Parasite (2019) small little spoiler/fun fact===In 6 Underground (2020) we can see, around the 15th minute, Ryan Reynolds recording a teaser youtube video on the set.===In Charlie's Angels (2000), the two boys Dylan encounters after escaping Knox's house are playing Final Fantasy 8, a game where the main characters are hired for covert missions similar to the Angels' line of work===In The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) instead of having Roger Moore return for a reshoot they just propped up a photo of him in front of the pyramid complex in Giza.",

      "aggregatedTitles": "===Barn Owls are well-known for their distinctive heart-shaped face, which helps funnel sound towards their ears like a satellite dish. Their ears are asymmetrical, meaning that one is higher than the other, and this helps them locate the precise location of prey in the dark.===This Manta Ray, named Inspector Clouseau, is the only known pink specimen. Researchers think the pink color results from an unusual expression of Melanin - the common protein that's involved in skin-tanning, albinism and melanism (melanism is why panthers are pitch black)===Major Mitchell's cockatoo (Lophochroa leadbeateri) is notable for its soft-textured white and salmon-pink plumage and large bright red and golden-yellow crest. Its habitat is restricted to arid and semi-arid inland areas of Australia. These birds are known to live for longer than 80 years.===Barn owls, like all owls, stagger the laying of their eggs, with approximately 2-3 days between each egg. With an average clutch size of 5-7 eggs by the time the youngest hatches the oldest can already be 2 weeks old.===The purple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis) is a rather stout-looking amphibian endemic to the Western Ghats of India. Because the frog only visibly appears above ground for a matter of days following the monsoon season, it was long overlooked by science, being only formally described in 2003.===The Indian paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone paradisi) is an eye-catching bird (especially the male of the white morph subspecies) owing to its two central tail feathers which extend into streamers that are commonly twice as long as the its body. It is a commonly seen bird in various parts of Asia.===Barred Owls are a mid-sized owl that are sometimes preyed upon by Great Horned Owls (an apex predator often called \"Tigers of the Sky\"). Barred Owl hoots follow a simple pattern that sounds like \"Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you all?\"===American black bears ironically show a great deal of color variation. These colors range from jet black, to various shades of brown and gray. There also exist white black bears, which are nicknamed \"spirit bears\".===The Amazonian royal flycatcher (Onychorhynchus coronatus) is an infrequently seen bird found in the forests and woodlands throughout most of the Amazon basin bearing a striking red hammerhead crest when displayed. Their nests generally hang over water making it difficult for predators to reach.===Screech Owls can be either red or gray, to blend in with different shades of tree bark. They like to keep their eyes almost shut to help camouflage===Red-shouldered hawks are easily identified by their frequent, noisy calls, their distinct markings, and the translucent crescents near their wingtips. Caution must be used when identifying these vocal birds by sound alone; blue jays can convincingly mimic their calls.===The beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) is an Arctic and sub-Arctic cetacean, and it is easily recognizable thanks to its stark white coloring and globular head. The word \"beluga\" comes from the Russian work \"bielo\" which means white. Belugas are interestingly capable of swimming backwards.===Bushbabies are any of several species of small attractive arboreal primates native to sub-Saharan Africa. The animals are ace jumpers, using powerful legs and extremely long tails to spring great distances. Also known as galagos, these mammals are mostly nocturnal have excellent night vision.===Bald Eagles do not get their signature white head and tail until they are 4-5yrs old. This Bald Eagle is not even a year old yet. It was born in Spring 2019. The best way to age a juvenile Bald Eagle is by the beak color and the amount of white on it. This one's beak is almost all black===The pygmy marmoset (Cebuella pygmaea) is the smallest monkey in the world and lives in the rainforests of the western Amazon Basin in South America. They are quite affectionate and are often seen grooming each other for hours on end. This baby marmoset is no bigger than the size of a human thumb.===Painted wolves populations in the Okavango Delta have been observed \"rallying\" before they set out to hunt. Not every rally results in a departure, but departure becomes more likely when more dogs \"sneeze\". When members of dominant mating pairs sneeze first, the group is much more likely to depart.===The Dumbo octopus acquired its adorable name from its resemblance to the title character of Disney's 1941 film Dumbo because of the octopus' prominent ear-like fins which extend from the mantle above each eye. They are among the deepest dwelling octopuses in the ocean and are exceedingly rare.===The mating rituals of manta rays involve forming ‘trains’ where the larger female is chased by several pursuing males who try to follow her fast and twisting movements. Whichever male can keep up the longest will gain the chance to mate.===Male American Kestrels arrive first to breeding grounds. As cavity nesters, kestrels utilize tree hollows, man-made buildings, or old woodpecker holes for nest sites. The males will seek out potential nest cavities and present them to the females, who make the final selection of a nesting place.===The grebes' leg movements are extremely fast. They take as many as 10 strides per second, which is faster than any other bird ever studied. They can run on water.===Unlike most reptiles, female alligators are actually very good and protective mothers. An alligator that is ready to lay eggs builds a large nest using mud, sticks and plants. She will lay 10-50 eggs on top of this nest and then cover them with more material. The decomposing plants warm the nest.===The eight-spotted crab spider (Platythomisus octomaculatus) is one of the most unnatural-looking spiders around with it highly contrasting black dots on a bright yellow abdomen. It was found in a forest preserve in Singapore in 1924, and it is among the largest crab spiders at one inch in length.===Baby cheetahs mimic the aggressive honey badgers in order to deter predators===Subtle variations in mobbing calls are predator-specific in great tits===Remoras' front dorsal fins have evolved to enable them to adhere by suction to the smooth surfaces of a host animal such as whale, turtle, shark or ray. Remoras get a free ride and protection, thus saving them valuable energy. The remora is doing its host a huge service by hoovering up parasites.",
