When water is in the shot, everything is real (and he is trying to block it out) and when fire is in the shot, everything is being made up.===In Star Wars: Rogue one (2016), the production team used a London subway station as a stage prop for the Empire base.===The Devil Guy in Star Wars (1977) was played by Rick Baker, who lent a bunch of his monster masks to the production during Cantina reshoots in LA.===In Thor: Ragnarok (2017) Director Taika Waititi can be seen playing the center head of a three headed being in the backround, the voice of the character Korg in the foreground and presumably directing the film from behind the camera all in one shot.===The Exorcist (1973) The scene where Regan projectile vomits at Father Karras only required one take. The vomit was intended to hit Jason Miller in the chest, but the plastic tubing misfired, hitting him in the face. His reaction of shock and disgust while wiping away the vomit is genuine.===In Galaxy Quest (1999) - Guy's uniform is missing the official patch, fancy zipper pull, second color tone, rank medals, and professional stitching because his costume is obviously homemade...===In Terminator: Dark Fate (2019) the Rev 9 sends sparks as it is dragged along the highway as it's disguise of pants and boots is a liquid metal exoskeleton.===Fight Club (1999) In a fight scene between edward norton and brad pitt, edward actually broke his thumb because brad pitt's stomach was too strong at the time.===In the film Dinosaur (2000), a Carnotaurus was used instead of the T-Rex due to The Lost World: Jurassic Park showing a softer, motherly side to the Rex. The Carno’s ferocity, and size was increased to equal the Rex’s, since a Carnotaurus is around the same size as an Iguanodon.===In Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) J. Allen Hynek makes a brief cameo towards the end. Hynek worked for the governments official UFO investigation program Project Blue Book and came up with the Close Encounter scale which the movie got its name from.===In Hot Fuzz (2007), the last names of the villagers are named after whatever their profession is.===In Pinocchio (1940) When Jiminy Cricket opens a book to tell the story of Pinocchio at the beginning of the film, two other books which Disney would later go on to animate are on the shelf. Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Peter Pan. (1953)===In The Abyss (1989) The Breathing Liquid that is used on the rat is actually real. 6 rats were used to shoot the scene and all survived. For the scenes with Ed Harris, the liquid in his helmet was real but he did not breathe it in.===In Spiderman: Homecoming (2017) Peter Parker requests his sandwhich to be smooshed flat, so that the ingredients dont fall out while web slinging.===At the start of Arthur Christmas (2011), while the elves are infiltrating a house, a woman is watching the 1982 film “The Snowman”.===In Avengers: Endgame (2019) you can hear a voice say \"I have telepathy\" when Thor walks over to Carol Danvers.===In the movie Wave (2019) featuring Justin Long, the phone number on the mans file is the Hall and Oats Emergency Help Line===In Gone Girl (2014) before we know the journal is fabricated, you can see all the different pens she will use to make it look like she wrote it over multiple years.===American Beauty (1999) - The tagline for this film is \"Look Closer.\" Conrad Hall first draws your eyes to the meaningless bowl of bright orange fruit, then the towel and reflective surfaces . The B&amp;W photo is the most important element in the frame. But you have to look closer to notice it...===In A Goofy Movie (1995) Max &amp; PJ share a pizza with eight slices. In the next scene, eight slices are seen scattered around the room, meaning they ate none of the pizza.===In Shrek 2 (2004) when the Fairy Godmother meets King Harold (Voiced by John Cleese) he mentions he has a bit of pain in his leg from ‘The Old Crusade’ This is a reference to Cleese’s character Basil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers who would usually feign a leg injury from ‘the Korean War’ when lying===In The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), former Racing Driver Keiichi Tsuchiya (right) made a cameo appearance as a Fisherman. Famously known as the \"Drift King\" in his native Japan, Tsuchiya also served as a stunt co-ordinator and stuntman for the film.===In Skyfall (2012), Silva offers Bond some scotch from 1962 and says that “it’s a particular favourite of yours”. 1962 is the year Dr No came out- the first bond film.===In Doctor Sleep (2019), the house number of Abra is shown to be 1980, a callback to the year of The Shining's release, 1980===A funny short movie in the movie Shazam! 2019(link in comments)",
