He's dressed for winter but it's summer here. Hydration is important.===LPT: Remember when opening gifts this holiday season that no one likes a good guesser.===LPT: If you're searching for a paper but getting paywalled, search the title on Google Scholar. Under the title, click \"All x versions\" and look for a link prefaced with \"[PDF]\". This will directly bring up a PDF of the article rather than a link to a host site.===LPT: parents of teens, give your child an innocuous sounding phrase to text you as a code for “get me out of here” when they want to avoid peer pressure but not look like they are bailing/lame===LPT: Significantly lower your expectations for Christmas gifts. Expect nothing, so when someone gets you anything, you'll have a genuine positive reaction.===LPT Teach young kids about saving and STOP the begging!===LPT: Parents, if you ever have a kid with a birthday on or around a holiday, go out of your way to differentiate between them.===LPT: When being thanked for a gift you gave, avoid saying it was nothing, or that it was on sale. Instead, tell the person receiver that you got it because of what they mean to you. This way, you amplify your efforts by making receiver feel like they are not just an afterthought.===LPT: Turn your thermostat down a few degrees before your Christmas parties. When everyone comes over the house gets hot really fast and makes the guests uncomfortable.===LPT: Always check the ethnic aisle for spices before baking aisle. You can usually find twice the amount for half the price===LPT Mamma animals often leave their babies for short periods to go and find food so PLEASE don't immediately bring in a lonely baby animal.===LPT: If your 2020 resolution is to lose weight and you want to step on the scale everyday, be consistent on the conditions in which you weigh yourself. Water and waste weight can make your scale fluctuate around 5 lbs on a daily basis.===LPT: When apologizing, ask what you can do differently. It shows you're not just talking, but willing to take action.===LPT: If someone in a meeting is interrupted, ask them to finish what they had been saying at the next opportunity. Ditto when two people start speaking at once, and then one person defers to the other. Meetings unfairly favour the most assertive and the talkative.===LPT: If you are out today/tomorrow, consider tipping a little more than you might usually. Your servers, hairdressers, bartenders etc are all working while the rest of us are out with friends and family enjoying ourselves===LPT: If your heat pump is not keeping up this winter, check your heat return line. Re-insulating it could give you immediate improvements in heating your house.===LPT - How to be a good house guest===LPT: When checking out at the grocery store, organize your items in logical bagging order as you put them on the conveyor belt, it makes everything go faster and the bagging/checkout clerks will thank you===LPT: Christmas can be stressful but remember, this may be the last time you’ll ever see certain family members and loved ones. Please make the most of it.===LPT: If your kids have dolls or figures with interesting bits (shoes, wands, guns, gloves) you can hot glue them on to prevent loss. Hot glue is easy to remove, especially on plastic toys. Just a dot works wonders.===LPT: when making nachos, put a tortilla underneath your chips to turn leftover toppings into a taco.===LPT if it can wait, shop for electronics and clothing after Christmas.
