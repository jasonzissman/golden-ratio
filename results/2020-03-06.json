      "aggregatedTitles": "===Young eaglets are not able to thermoregulate until they are over about two weeks of age. Because of this, parent bald eagles will continue to brood their young after hatching. They will curl their fearsome talons to prevent any injuries to their eaglets.===The Louisiana Green Tree Frog, Hyla cinerea, has been shown to choose prey not by size, but by activity level. 90% of prey was actively pursued, while only 10% was prey that wandered within striking distance. They have also been called the \"bell frog\" because of their distinct croak. Pic by me.===This long necked wierdo is called a gerenuk aka a giraffe gazelle and they have heavy butts for balance. Only the males have horns. They eat the lower part of trees beneath the giraffes and over the other plant eating mammals. They often weigh around 39 kilos (85.9 pounds)===The kiwi bird lays the largest eggs in proportion to its size of any bird in the world. The hatchlings are remarkably independent, and will leave the nest not long after hatching.===All 3 species of zebra have stripes; they must be important, but their main purpose is unclear. They may cool the zebra w/ the contrast increasing airflow; zebras indeed have more stripes in hotter climates. The complexity has also shown to confuse biting flies - which carry disease - when landing.===The six-plumed birds of paradise, native to New Guinea, perform an impressive courtship ritual which includes preparing the stage by carefully clearing the forest floor, decorating the floor with red berries and rubbing branches with snake skin, and this is followed by an elaborate umbrella dance.===Little Red flying foxes like to hang in clusters, like a bunch of grapes, whereas other species of flying foxes hang separate from each other. They‚Äôre known for damaging trees as they are hanging in dense pockets across the branches and breaking them!===The Araripe manakin (Antilophia bokermanni) is a critically endangered bird first discovered in 1996. It is endemic to the Araripe uplands in northeastern Brazil. It is estimated there are fewer than 700 of these birds in existence. It is easily identified by its vermilion red helmet-like crown.===Megalodon, meaning \"big tooth\", is an extinct species of shark that lived approximately 23 to 3.6 million years ago, during the Early Miocene to the Pliocene. It was formerly thought to be a member of the family Lamnidae and a close relative of the great white shark.===The semiplumbeous hawk is found in Central America and Colombia, and it often follows the large swarms of army ants that travel through tropical forests in order to capture it usual prey, antbirds, but occasionally it will feed on other small birds and bats. Its population is estimated to be &lt;10K.===45 different types of crows and ravens===The archer fish's most notable attribute is its uncanny ability to fire a \"super-soaker\" jet of water to knock down its insect prey into the water where it is quickly eaten. They can spray up to 10 ft with astonishing precision while at the same time compensating for the water refraction angle.===The broad-striped Malagasy mongoose (Galidictis fasciata) is native to the eastern forests of Madagascar. Their main distinguishing factors are their dark horizontal stripes and long bushy tails. Their primary prey is small rodents and they are mostly active in the evening and at night.===Golden eagles that live in the western continental U.S. tend to remain in their ranges year-round which generally means they have to manage to survive sometimes long and harsh winters. They will often return to their frozen prey during such times to feed if fresh prey is not readily accessible.===A shark rides the wave in to grab a fish on the beach, and has to \"sand swim\" back to the surf. Sharks have amazing abilities to sense for food, even on beaches, and then return to water when stranded on land, and they also have a good sense of direction as well.===Nursery Web Spiders build cozy web-homes for their offspring, like this one built around several large leaves. Female Nursery Webs, like lots of spiders and their cousins, also tend to kill the males around mating time - to get around this, the guys play dead!===The sarcastic fringehead (Neoclinus blanchardi) is a very bellicose saltwater fish that can open its mouth widely and use it as an assault weapon when engaging in territorial battles. They joust by pushing their distended mouths against each other, as if they were kissing, to determine dominance.===The umbrellabird is a large, tropical species of bird found in the rainforests of Central and South America. Its most distinctive feature is the inflatable wattle on its neck which serves to amplify its loud, booming calls. The male flares its crest into the shape of an umbrella during courtship.===The southern ground hornbill is a large predatory bird from South Africa. These birds live in open woodland, savannah, and grasslands. They eat insects, amphibians, mammals, birds, and reptiles and are large enough to eat hares and chase eagles away from prey!===That‚Äôs what I believe===The bones of chameleons can glow through their skin for animals with UV-sensitive eyes===The bald eagle is a bird of prey found in North America. A sea eagle, it has two known subspecies and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle. Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico.===The golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) is one of the best-known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere. It is the most widely distributed species of eagle. Like all eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae. These birds are dark brown, with lighter golden-brown plumage on their napes.===The largest cave fish in the world were recently discovered by biologists in the Chympe Cave in India. They have primarily subsisted on bat guano which falls into the pools from above. The fish weigh about 2 lbs and measure 13 in on average, making them 10x the size of previously known cave fish.===The blue-capped ifrit (Ifrita kowaldi), native to New Guinea, is among a small group of bird species that are poisonous. They excrete batrachotoxin into their feathers and skin in order to defend themselves against predators. The poison is derived from the bird's diet of certain types of beetles.",

It is endemic to the Araripe uplands in northeastern Brazil. It is estimated there are fewer than 700 of these birds in existence. It is easily identified by its vermilion red helmet-like crown.===The semiplumbeous hawk is found in Central America and Colombia, and it often follows the large swarms of army ants that travel through tropical forests in order to capture it usual prey, antbirds, but occasionally it will feed on other small birds and bats.

Their primary prey is small rodents and they are mostly active in the evening and at night.===The umbrellabird is a large, tropical species of bird found in the rainforests of Central and South America. Its most distinctive feature is the inflatable wattle on its neck which serves to amplify its loud, booming calls. The male flares its crest into the shape of an umbrella during courtship.===Up close with a humpback whale===The sarcastic fringehead (Neoclinus blanchardi) is a very bellicose saltwater fish that can open its mouth widely and use it as an assault weapon when engaging in territorial battles.

Sharks have amazing abilities to sense for food, even on beaches, and then return to water when stranded on land, and they also have a good sense of direction. Sharks are actually quite smart.===Golden eagles that live in the western continental U.S. tend to remain in their ranges year-round which generally means they have to manage to survive sometimes long and harsh winters. They will often return to their frozen prey during such times to feed if fresh prey is not readily available.===The archer fish's most notable attribute is its uncanny ability to fire a \"super-soaker\" jet of water to knock down its insect prey into the water where it is quickly eaten. They can spray up to 10 ft with astonishing precision while at the same time compensating for the water refraction angle.===5 Major Extinctions of Planet Earth===The pearly razorfish (Xyrichtys novacula) has the remarkable ability to escape predators by diving headfirst into the sand in a split-second breath-taking maneuver. It can also use its razor-sharp teeth to cut fishing line and netting by rotating its jaw to more than 90¬∞ to clip any entanglement.===Mitochondria (the powerhouse of the cell) moving inside Neurons. Mitochondria play an essential role in neuron function. They provide the energy and metabolites needed to form and maintain neural junctions, remove or repair old/damaged components, and deliver new materials.===Analemma of the sun in the Northern Hemisphere over one year.
