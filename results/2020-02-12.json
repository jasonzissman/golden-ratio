Despite possibly having to be put on a wait list, it can be a good way to rent and see free movies.===LPT: Never loan friends or family money you can't afford to lose===LPT: DO NOT propose in public on Valentine's day unless you already know they want to accept in public.===LPT: if you want to rave about the work someone‚Äôs done, don‚Äôt tell them - tell their supervisor===LPT: Do NOT contact clients or workers in a casual manner on social media after working with them.===LPT: Wondering if you want kids? Consider whether or not kids would want YOU.===LPT: Wipe the water off your body after a shower===LPT: If you‚Äôre feeling sad, a small act of kindness for someone else can help improve your mood.===LPT: When having to cancel plans with a friend, reschedule immediately.===LPT: Start buying flying tickets in incognito mode. If you search for it normally, and you do it several times, or if you look for the specific way often (regularly), the price might be higher over time.===LPT: When you get a compliment, note it down on your phone. Reading nice things people have said about you can boost your mood if you're ever feeling low.===LPT: combine your cover letter, resume and references into a single .pdf, save it as your full name and then submit through your portal of choice.===LPT: Turn your jeans inside out when washing/drying them. The color will fade much less!===LPT: Empty the bottom rack of the dishwasher before the top rack.===LPT: If your SO says to not get them anything for Valentines Day, at least get them a card regardless.===LPT: Go out to a restaurant on horrible weather days. No wait, you'll get great service and the servers will appreciate your patronage (and tips!)===LPT: I've been getting double ads on YT frequently today. So if you want to watch a video without ads, just go to the end and replay. Ads are gone. Enjoy===LPT: use a shower/shower head to add extra bubbles to your bubble bath.===LPT: if you‚Äôre spiritual/religious, don‚Äôt tell your atheist friends that you‚Äôre praying for them.

It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===Notice: As of 2/10/2020, we are requiring sources (in comments) for trivial details.===In this scene of Jojo Rabbit (2019), \"Heil Hitler\" is said 31 times in one minute! According to writer/director Taika Waititi, he wanted a funny moment, but also wanted to illustrate how ridiculous Nazi protocols were.===When Taika Waititi, who is Maori/Jewish, was asked about why he chose to play the role of Adolf Hitler in Jo Jo Rabbit(2019), he said \"The answer's simple, what better 'fuck you' to the guy?\"===In Forrest Gump (1994), the way Forrest looks at Bubba after he stops talking indicates that he actually was listening to his shrimp ramblings the whole time, which is probably also the reason Forrest and Bubba were punished to clean the barracks even though Gump was praised by the Drill Sergeant.===Jojo Rabbit (2019)===In Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989), the walls of the movie lot can be seen (painted blue for the sky) - which was actually shot in Mexico City===In Parasite (2019) literal lines are used throughout the movie noting whether if a character ‚Äòcrossed the line‚Äô or not.===In the movie Cars 2 (2011) you can see a frame in which a car is portrayed as the pope, this frame implies that there was a Jesus car who died on the cross to save the whole car race (pun intended) from their sins.===In Howl's Moving Castle (2004), Sophie towards the end of the movie tells a young Howl from the past ‚ÄúI know how to help you now. Find me in the future.\" When we first encounter Howl at the beginning he tells Sophie \"There you are, sweetheart. Sorry I'm late. I was looking everywhere for you.\"===On jojo rabbit (2019) captain Klenzendorf and Finkel are insinuated to have a gay romance throughout the movie. On one of the final scenes, their self designed costumes are decorated with pink triangles, which were used to mark gay men on concentration camps===Details in Parasite(2019) that you might miss if you're unfamiliar with South Korea===In ‚ÄúThe Doors‚Äù (1991) Val Kilmer sings all of Jim Morrison‚Äôs vocals himself. He was so convincing that surviving members of The Doors mistook Kilmer‚Äôs singing for Morrison‚Äôs. To prepare, he learned 50 songs and spent a year as Jim. He actually had to go to therapy to get out of character.===In Titanic (1997), the team had to rearrange the set so it could be flipped (because only one side of the Titanic was built to film). The only thing they forgot to do was tell the extras not to use their dominant hand, which is why a lot of extras on the shore are waving with their left hand.===UP (2009) When Up's Carl visits a travel agent, one of the framed brochures on her desk features a character from \"Knick Knack,\" a Pixar short about the secret life of travel souvenirs that the company made before Toy Story.===In Parasite (2019), the Scholar's Stone floats in the sewage water, revealing that the rock is fake &amp; hollow: this explains why Ki-woo survived the head blow and implies that the dream for upward social mobility (which the stone represents) is full of hollow promises===In Toy Story 3 (2010) At Sunnyside Day Care, we see a child wearing a shirt with a lightning bolt and the number 95 on it. Ka-chow! That's a reference to Lightning McQueen. In addition to being the racer's number, 95 also commemorates the year 1995, when Toy Story was released.===The opening song in JoJo Rabbit (2019) is \"Komm, gib mir deine Hand\" (1964), the German language version of The Beatles' \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\". The closing song is the German version of David Bowie's \"Heroes\" (1977), which is about two lovers separated by the Berlin Wall.===Joseph Gordon-Levitt has a cameo in Knives Out (2019) as the detective in the show Marta's sister Alice is watching. He has appeared in all the movies Rian Johnson has directed.===In Fargo (1996), Carl says ‚Äú30 minutes, Jerry we wrap this thing up‚Äù when there are exactly 30 minutes of the movie remaining.===In Jurassic Park(1993), Alan Grant tries to buckle his belt with two of the same type of buckle. This foreshadows a big turning point in the movie as female dinosaurs find a way to reproduce.===In this scene of Spies Like Us (1985), \"Doctor\" is said 46 times in ~one minute! According to writer/director Dan Akroyd/John Landis, they wanted a funny moment. Also it illustrates how ridiculous greetings were.===In Parasite (2019), Chung-sook, the poor family's mother, won a silver medal in a track-and-field event when she was younger. Later in the movie, she was performing a hammer throw in the rich family's backyard.===Monsters University (2013) When Don Carlton flashes his business card, the address is 1200 Dark Avenue. This is a nod to the actual Pixar Animation Studios location, which is 1200 Park Avenue in Emeryville, California.===In Jojo Rabbit (2019), the nostrils of Jojo‚Äôs robot costume are the SS logo===[SPOILER] In the movie Parasite (2019), the portrait drawn by the rich family's kid is not a self portrait but the \"ghost\" he'd seen.===In Police Academy 3: Back in Training (1986), during a short musical number Sgt Jones played by Michael Winslow is playing his bass guitar backwards.
