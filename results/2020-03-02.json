It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===Notice: As of 2/10/2020, we are requiring sources (in comments) for trivial details.===In Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), the villainous Immortan Joe is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who also played Toecutter in Mad Max (1979).===Miyazaki adds to all his films, including ‚ÄúSpirited Away‚Äù (2002), quiet little scenes of inaction, called ‚ÄòMa‚Äô, where the character just glances into the horizon and reflects, as a way to have a breathing room amid constant action (citation inside)===In Return of the Killer Tomatoes! (1988), John Astin (as Professor Gangreen) comes out in the same suit he wore when he played Gomez Addams on the TV show The Addams Family.===In Dodgeball (2004) the money that ends up allowing the protagonist to buy his competitors gym and subsequently save his own is in a box labeled ‚Äúdeus ex machina‚Äù===In ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù (2019) there are multiple references to Gotham being infested with ‚Äúsuper rats.‚Äù When Arthur is being fired from his job, you can see a super rat scurry around the corner in the lower right of the frame.===In Ant-man (2015), at the beginning of the movie, Luis tells Scott that he was the only one to ever knock out Peachy in their ritual ‚Äúgoodbye ceremony‚Äù, later Luis fights four men knocking all of them out with a single finch to the face (minus a guy punch). He‚Äôs the only one in the film to do this.===In Chicken Little (2005), the China Shop is owned by a bull.===In Godzilla: King of Monsters (2019) Dr. Chen is a twin and says she is 3rd generation Monarch. One photo she has is her twin mother and aunt and it is marked \"INFANT ISLAND, 1961\". The original Mothra was released in 1961. It starts on Infant Island and involves a set of fairy twins.===The abandoned underground station film of Alan Moore's graphic novel, V for Vendetta (2005), is the disused Aldwych Station on the Strand in London. It was built in 1907 as part of a major expansion which never happened, and was closed in 1994.===The quidditch scene in \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" from 2002 is scored with music from \"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones\" from 2002. This is because of a confusion between William Ross and John William who was composing for Attack of the Clones at the time.===In The Truman Show (1998) these arches read 'Unus Pro Omnibus, Omnes Pro Uno' which means in Latin 'One for everyone, Everyone for one'===In The Hunt for Red October (1990) the character's start out speaking Russian then switch to English upon a character saying the word \"Armageddon\". Armageddon is the same in both language===Thanos uses the Soul Stone to identify Doctor Strange in Avengers: Infinity War (2018). Thanos forcefully whisks away the projections, before temporarily appearing to knock Strange's soul out of his body, as evidenced by the few frames of Strange's astral form \"catching up\" to his physical body.===In Schindler's List (1993), Oskar Schindler is seen talking to the photographer woman and giving her money to make her take a picture of him with the SS officer later on.===In spirited away (2003) the magic paper that‚Äôs trying to get to Hakku by following Sen makes a cone shape near her ear so she‚Äôll hear the voices in the next room and find Hakku.===In \"Pan's Labyrinth\" (2007) the pale man's fireplace resembles an angular fish.

      "aggregatedTitles": "===Like other toucans, the emerald toucanet (Aulacorhynchus prasinus) is a colorful bird with a large bill which it uses for eating fruits. Native to Central America, it is common in humid forests, mainly at higher elevations. When moving around in groups, they play \"follow-the-leader\" for safety.===The signature \"eagle\" scream often heard in pop culture media actually belongs to the red-tailed hawk!===The jaws of a jaguar are stronger than any other species of cat. With these strong jaws, they will crunch down on bones and eat them. Their jaws are strong enough to crack a sea turtle's shell.In fact, in the zoo, bones are part of a jaguars' regular diet.===Frogfishes have a stocky appearance and rarely swim, preferring to clamber over the sea bottom using their fins as feet. Typically, they take cover lying in wait for prey, and then they strike extremely rapidly in as little as 6 milliseconds. They are found in most tropical and subtropical oceans.===This carpet shark, native to the northern Australian coast, is a long, slender shark that tends to be creamy or brown with variously-sized dark spots. They forage for food in tidal pools and risk being stranded, but they can survive for an hour without oxygenation or simply walk back to the ocean.===The jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi) or eyra is a furtive, mostly diurnal, wild feline native to southern North America and South America with relatively short legs, an elongated body, and a long bushy tail. The ears are short and rounded, and its coat is without spots and uniform in color.===The peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), also known historically as the duck hawk in North America. The Peregrine is renowned for its speed, reaching over 200 mph during its characteristic hunting stoop, making it the fastest bird in the world and the fastest member of the animal kingdom.===The Black Ribbon Eel (Rhinomuraena quaesita) is black and yellow and resembles an undulating ribbon while swimming. It is found in lagoons and reefs in Indo-Pacific waters and is easily recognizable by its long body, high dorsal fin, expanded anterior nostrils, and wide-opened mouth when alarmed.===Tasmanian Devils have incredibly strong jaws. In proportion to their body weight, they have the strongest bite of any living animal. Thanks to their powerful jaws and large, sharp teeth, Tassie Devils eat nearly all of their prey, even the bones.===Sociable Weaver build the largest nest of any bird and they can house over a hundred pairs of birds. Large nesting colonies can be active across many generations, sometimes over a hundred years.===Spotted hyena cubs are born all black but gradually shed this 'lanugo', starting with the head and then spreading down the neck towards the back of their bodies. The rate at which the lanugo is shed can be an accurate way of aging cubs.===The Spanish dancer (Hexabranchus sanguineus) is one of the largest sea slugs in the world and it can grow to 90 cm in length. Like most nudibranchs, it is brightly colored and venomous. When disturbed on the ocean floor, the slug folds its edges and undulates its body using flamenco moves to escape.===The Lady Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae), or rainbow finch, is a colorful passerine bird native to Australia. Interestingly, female finches are able to control the sex ratio of their offspring and reduce the rate of female offspring mortality by choosing mates according to their head color.===The reef stonefish (Synanceia verrucosa) is not only a master predator but one of the most venomous fish in the world, even lethal to humans. Its appearance is that of a crusty rock affording the fish uncanny camouflage. Each of its 13 dorsal spines has two venom sacs containing 3 deadly toxins.===When a bearded dragon headbangs, he is showing dominance.===The Bagworm Moth Caterpillar Builds a Log Cabin===The ªI ªiwi (Drepanis coccinea) is a species of Hawaiian honeycreeper. The ªI ªiwi's scarlet feathers were once highly prized by Hawaiian nobility for use in decorating their traditional feather cloaks and feathered helmets. The ªI ªiwi is the third most common native land bird in the Hawaiian Islands.===The Gopher Tortoise saves hundreds of animals' lives during wildfires in the southeast USA. They dig deep burrows into elevated hills of sandy soil, and snakes, amphibians, rodents and other small mammals all crowd in for refuge during the fires===The Halloween Moon Crab is found in mangroves and sand dunes along the Pacific coast from Mexico south to Panama. It also lives in the rainforests at least some of its adult life, but needs to return to the ocean to breed. It is largely herbivorous consuming mostly leaf litter and seedlings.===The Persian cat (Persian: ⁄Øÿ±ÿ®Ÿá ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ€å‚Äé, romanized: Gorbe ƒ™rƒÅnƒ´) is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by its round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the \"Persian Longhair\" in the English-speaking countries.===Your dog's ice-cold nose may be a sensor for detecting heat at distance. Instead of detecting heat through conduction or convection, the nose might be able to directly detect weak infrared radiation released by a warm body or object through photons.===Sea angels are small, free-swimming sea slugs with wing-like flapping appendages used for locomotion. Some species of sea angels feed exclusively on sea butterflies which are extremely small, transparent free-swimming sea snails. Sea angels secrete toxic chemicals to ward off potential predators.===Livingstone's turaco (Tauraco livingstonii) is a species of bird distributed throughout the subtropical lowlands of southeastern Africa. It is easily identified by its red, white and black eye patches, dark red beak, and a bold green crest sporting white floral flourishes. It mostly eats fruits.===A juvenile Staghorn Hydrocoral settles on a shell occupied by a hermit crab. It grows into a colony, all the while exuding chemicals which erode the shell. Eventually the shell is dissolved and the hydrocoral takes up residence on the exposed carapace and abdomen of the crab. Both animals benefit.===The ManhattAnt is a unique species of ant found only in New York City. Biologists stumbled upon them in the Broadway medians at 63rd and 76th streets in 2010, and the biologists claim the ant species does not match any of the 13,000 known species. The ants subsist on a diet high in corn syrup.",
