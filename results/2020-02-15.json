It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===Notice: As of 2/10/2020, we are requiring sources (in comments) for trivial details.===In Edge of Tomorrow (2014) the sword that Rita Vrataski uses in the movie is a modified helicopter propeller blade.===In Labyrinth (1986) the animatronic for the character Hoggle was lost at an airport. Left unclaimed for years it was eventually bought and restored. It now resides at the Unclaimed Baggage museum in Scottsboro, Alabama.===In this scene of The Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Ring (2001), Sam overcomes his fear of leaving the safety of the shire. This is reflected by the crows in the background which have overcome their fear of the scarecrow.===In the movie, Coco (2017) the conductor of Ernesto de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacle was modeled after Michael Giacchino, the composer of the movie's music score.===In Short Circuit (1986) and Short Circuit 2 (1988), Johnny 5’s creator, an Indian robotics expert, was played by a white actor in brown face===In Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) The sound clip used during cap lifting Mjolnir is the same that they played during cap jumping the bridge in his first movie.===The music of Elvis Presley is major component of \"Lilo and Stitch\" [2002]. In addition to the use of several songs in the film, the end credits contain multiple visual references to the Elvis film \"Blue Hawaii\"[1961].===In Jojo Rabbit (2019) the partnership between Captain Klenzendorf and Finkel is a clever refrence to how homosexuals had to hide their desires in plain sight during these times of war and in the early 1900's in general. And Captain K's special uniform is a reference to the drag clothing style.===In Interstellar (2014), Brand mentions Miller most likely died minutes before Cooper's arrival due to the extreme time slippage. This means that the wave we see headed away from them earlier in the movie is the same wave that killed Miller.===In War Dogs (2016) the guitarist singing in the retirement home is David Packouz, whom Miles Teller plays in the film and whose life the film is based on.===In Captain America Winter Soldier (2014) when Steve Rogers is making his PA announcement revealing that SHIELD has been compromised by Hydra, he states that they “shot Nick Fury” rather than “killed Nick Fury” because he claimed earlier that he is always honest.===In Toy Story (1995), Sid has a book called the \"Department of the Army Technical Manual: Improvised Interrogation Handbook\"===The bus Kiki nearly collides with in Kiki's Delivery Service (1989) has STUDIO GHIBLI written on the side.===In Parasite (2019) right after a certain tense scene the number of seats around the table shows us how many people actually live in the house===In Joker (2019), the license plate of the police cruiser Arthur is in says “Industry First,” highlighting social divide in Gotham City and, in particular, whose side the police are on.===The original poster for Pulp Fiction (1994) features the pulp novel \"Harlot In Her Heart\". Since no one had bothered to obtain the rights to use the images of the the book (or the pack of Lucky Strikes) the poster was quickly recalled and the book title altered to a much more generic \"Pulp Fiction\".===In The Animatrix (2003), the Machine Ambassadors initially resemble humans at their UN peace offering. We reject them outright. Later, they are much more sinister looking, symbolizing having given up on humanity.===In Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Arnold Schwarzenegger received $15 million for delivering a total of 700 words of dialogue. That works out to $85,716 for saying, \"Hasta la vista, baby.\"===In Pirate's of the Caribbean (2003), Captain Jack Sparrow tells two of Barbossa's crewmen that \"The deepest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers and mutineers\". This is a reference to Dante's Inferno, where the 9th circle of hell (the deepest circle) is Treachery.===In “Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me” [1999], when Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach perform a song, their percussionist is playing Austin’s Swedish Penis Pump as an instrument.===While watching Honey, I Blew up the Kid (1992) I saw two Easter eggs inside the warehouse while Wayne and Diane were looking for the shrinking machine!===In Joker (2019), in the bottom right of the screen you can see one of the \"super rats\" run around the corner of the building. These were referenced earlier in the film on a news broadcast.===The bees in Bee Movie (2007) only have eye colors of Blue or Brown because they begin with the letter B===In Shrek 2 (2001) during the argument between Harold and Lillian, the posters beside Lillian are showing Harold over lilypads. Incidentally, the flowers on the lilypads look like crowns.===The Darth Vader scene in Back to the Future (1985) has a deleted part where Marty knocks George out with chloroform before leaving. It’s why George tells Marty in the next scene that he slept so long that he missed school.",

      "aggregatedTitles": "===This is the Japanese raccoon dog, also known as a Tanuki in Japanese. It is sometimes classified as its own species due to unique features absent in mainland raccoon dogs.===The trunk is used to drink, smell, pick up food, touch and communicate - this baby elephant is discovering their trunk===Four new species of epaulette walking sharks were recently discovered off the coast of Australia and Papua New Guinea which are able to travel short distances over land because of their ability to walk using their pectoral fins and live in low to no oxygen conditions for extended periods of time.===Barn Owls are well-known for their distinctive heart-shaped face, which helps funnel sound towards their ears like a satellite dish. Their ears are asymmetrical, meaning that one is higher than the other, and this helps them locate the precise location of prey in the dark.===This Manta Ray, named Inspector Clouseau, is the only known pink specimen. Researchers think the pink color results from an unusual expression of Melanin - the common protein that's involved in skin-tanning, albinism and melanism (melanism is why panthers are pitch black)===The purple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis) is a rather stout-looking amphibian endemic to the Western Ghats of India. Because the frog only visibly appears above ground for a matter of days following the monsoon season, it was long overlooked by science, being only formally described in 2003.===Major Mitchell's cockatoo (Lophochroa leadbeateri) is notable for its soft-textured white and salmon-pink plumage and large bright red and golden-yellow crest. Its habitat is restricted to arid and semi-arid inland areas of Australia. These birds are known to live for longer than 80 years.===Barn owls, like all owls, stagger the laying of their eggs, with approximately 2-3 days between each egg. With an average clutch size of 5-7 eggs by the time the youngest hatches the oldest can already be 2 weeks old.===The Indian paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone paradisi) is an eye-catching bird (especially the male of the white morph subspecies) owing to its two central tail feathers which extend into streamers that are commonly twice as long as the its body. It is a commonly seen bird in various parts of Asia.===Barred Owls are a mid-sized owl that are sometimes preyed upon by Great Horned Owls (an apex predator often called \"Tigers of the Sky\"). Barred Owl hoots follow a simple pattern that sounds like \"Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you all?\"===American black bears ironically show a great deal of color variation. These colors range from jet black, to various shades of brown and gray. There also exist white black bears, which are nicknamed \"spirit bears\".===The Amazonian royal flycatcher (Onychorhynchus coronatus) is an infrequently seen bird found in the forests and woodlands throughout most of the Amazon basin bearing a striking red hammerhead crest when displayed. Their nests generally hang over water making it difficult for predators to reach.===Screech Owls can be either red or gray, to blend in with different shades of tree bark. They like to keep their eyes almost shut to help camouflage===Red-shouldered hawks are easily identified by their frequent, noisy calls, their distinct markings, and the translucent crescents near their wingtips. Caution must be used when identifying these vocal birds by sound alone; blue jays can convincingly mimic their calls.===The beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) is an Arctic and sub-Arctic cetacean, and it is easily recognizable thanks to its stark white coloring and globular head. The word \"beluga\" comes from the Russian work \"bielo\" which means white. Belugas are interestingly capable of swimming backwards.===Bushbabies are any of several species of small attractive arboreal primates native to sub-Saharan Africa. The animals are ace jumpers, using powerful legs and extremely long tails to spring great distances. Also known as galagos, these mammals are mostly nocturnal have excellent night vision.===Bald Eagles do not get their signature white head and tail until they are 4-5yrs old. This Bald Eagle is not even a year old yet. It was born in Spring 2019. The best way to age a juvenile Bald Eagle is by the beak color and the amount of white on it. This one's beak is almost all black===The pygmy marmoset (Cebuella pygmaea) is the smallest monkey in the world and lives in the rainforests of the western Amazon Basin in South America. They are quite affectionate and are often seen grooming each other for hours on end. This baby marmoset is no bigger than the size of a human thumb.===Painted wolves populations in the Okavango Delta have been observed \"rallying\" before they set out to hunt. Not every rally results in a departure, but departure becomes more likely when more dogs \"sneeze\". When members of dominant mating pairs sneeze first, the group is much more likely to depart.===The Dumbo octopus acquired its adorable name from its resemblance to the title character of Disney's 1941 film Dumbo because of the octopus' prominent ear-like fins which extend from the mantle above each eye. They are among the deepest dwelling octopuses in the ocean and are exceedingly rare.===The mating rituals of manta rays involve forming ‘trains’ where the larger female is chased by several pursuing males who try to follow her fast and twisting movements. Whichever male can keep up the longest will gain the chance to mate.===Male American Kestrels arrive first to breeding grounds. As cavity nesters, kestrels utilize tree hollows, man-made buildings, or old woodpecker holes for nest sites. The males will seek out potential nest cavities and present them to the females, who make the final selection of a nesting place.===The grebes' leg movements are extremely fast. They take as many as 10 strides per second, which is faster than any other bird ever studied. They can run on water.===Unlike most reptiles, female alligators are actually very good and protective mothers. An alligator that is ready to lay eggs builds a large nest using mud, sticks and plants. She will lay 10-50 eggs on top of this nest and then cover them with more material. The decomposing plants warm the nest.===The eight-spotted crab spider (Platythomisus octomaculatus) is one of the most unnatural-looking spiders around with it highly contrasting black dots on a bright yellow abdomen. It was found in a forest preserve in Singapore in 1924, and it is among the largest crab spiders at one inch in length.",
