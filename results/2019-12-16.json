They have a muscular tail as long as their body, which they use both to grapple onto trees and communicate with other Binturongs.

Curiously, they still engage in ‚Äòmating behaviour‚Äô and courtship rituals with one another.===Kiwi are the only birds with external nostrils at the ends of their beaks. Their beaks are long and tipped with many sensor pits to detect worms and other invertebrates underground and in vegetation. Consequently, Kiwi can often be heard loudly snuffling and snorting to clear out their nostrils.===The corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus) is a North American species of rat snake that is named for the species' regular presence near grain stores, where it preys on mice and rats.
