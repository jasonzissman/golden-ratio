Here's how.===LPT: Use the Laundry Basket Method to declutter your home quickly and efficiently===LPT - Bring your own travel mug to Starbucks, they usually fill it to the top regardless of what size you order, getting you extra coffee or latte for free===LPT: Start writing stand up jokes daily. Just do it in a notes page on your phone. It forces you to find the funny in everything and it will make you laugh every day.===LPT: The Tasty App is really great for people trying to include more cooking in their routine. Although it might seem like a viral cliche, the videos included with the recipe are helpful!===LPT: Don't know how to smile for photos? Laugh!===LPT: Windows 7 support ends today but you can still upgrade to Windows 10 for free with a valid copy of Windows 7 or 8===LPT: Work a short exercise into your day. Make it a habit to do twenty-five jumping jacks every time you come out of the hand washing room. It won't take much time from your day, but it will greatly improve your health.===LPT: if you're going away on holiday, watch a few vlogs of the location. They would of done their research of the location so you don't have to!===LPT: Hate those annoying ad-filled, 5000-word monologues before recipes? Select 'Print' (usually right above the actual recipe) to view ONLY the recipe. Works on phones and computers!===LPT: if you make a mistake while others are watching, know that you're giving those others permission to be human. Even better, if you handle it well your aplomb will help them do the same. Everyone wins.===LPT: If your inhaler's empty, put it in warm water for a few seconds. You should be able to get another couple of toots from it.===LPT: Put monthly or bi-monthly reminders on your phone calendar to call different extended family members. A lot of older relatives are lonely and even a five-minute phone call can make their whole week.===LPT: To soak burned food off a dish that doesn't fit in the sink, use the \"upside down water glass\" trick===LPT: If you live in a very humid climate, and have a wall A/C unit, you can use the \"dry\" feature on it to de-humidify (or dry) the room.===LPT: Have a plan for what to do if you ever get locked out of your house. If you’re a parent, discuss a plan with your kids.===LPT: Hoard honey, it lasts forever and with the decline of the honeybee population, in the future it will potentially be worth many times what it is now.===LPT: If your printer is out of black ink and it’s impossible to replace it in time, change the font colour to very dark brown and print in colour.",

Coleman Reese (Joshua Harto) deduces Batman’s identity with little effort, like The Riddler has in the comics. He’s also addressed as “Mr. Reese,” a homonym of mysteries like how the Riddler is E. Nygma/enigma===In 1408 (2007), the wine that Olin has is called \"Les Cinquant Sept Décès,\" which means \"The 57 Deaths.\" Olin had previously and repeatedly mentioned that 56 people had gone and died in 1408, which suggests that Mike was doomed to go die from the start.===In Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011), when Ceaser says his first word, the camerawork foreshadows the apes rising to become the dominant species.

Despite Popular Myth, There Is No Additional Value To Them Being Male, As They Are Sterile.===When an infant koala – called a joey – is born, it immediately climbs up to its mother’s pouch.

They dive from 30 m (98 ft) up at speeds of 100 kmph (62 mph).===Rats use laugh-like vocalizations to signal playful intentions to other rats.===\"The octopus is one of the most bizarre life forms on Earth – one of the smartest, most interesting, and most alien, with eight more brains than you have.\"===There are over 60 species of conch.

This one happens to be a baby.===Turkey Vultures have a developed olfactory sense, allowing them to smell their next meal from hundreds of feet away (and even through forest canopy)!===Gouldian / Rainbow Finch. Females have been proven to \"control\" their offspring's sex. If she bangs a male of a different head color, they'll produce many more sons (even if the color was painted on). That's because mating between black-heads and red-heads lead to high death rates for female babies.===Woodrats in the Genus Neotoma are native rodents of North America. They build large structures, called middens, out of sticks, vegetative material, bones, etc. Each species specializes in their own type of midden material, like this desert woodrat that uses materials from cactus to build its midden.===Dogs' tails are so important for communication, that dogs whose tails have been docked are twice as likely to be involved in fights than dogs with intact tails.===Brachygastra mellifica is one of the few species of wasps that produces honey.

When leaping between thorny bushes, bushbabies fold back their ears to protect them.===Impala calves grow up together in creches which are groups of young that play, groom, and move together.===When in danger, the Malabar giant squirrel often freezes or flattens itself against the tree trunk, instead of fleeing.===Many trees, such as this California Coast Live Oak that burnt in a wildfire, can regrow tissue even after burning. Some grow leaves out of their trunk, called epicormal growth, and some resprout from their roots, sometimes both.===Three-toed sloths have extra neck vertebrae that give them almost a 360-degree view of their environment, a powerful defense mechanism for one of nature’s slowest moving creatures.===Baby elephants can't use their trunks properly until they 6-8 months old. Before that, they constantly swing them to and fro and sometimes even trip over them. They also suck their trunk just as a human baby might suck its thumb.===Cat can actually speak in English/other language. A secret code of meows develops between cat and its owner, unique to that cat alone. So they are smart enough to imitate sound similar to their owner. This adorable creature can actually produce about 100 different vocalizations.===[oc] Blue Iguanas are endangered and native to the island of Grand Cayman===All three thresher shark species have been listed as vulnerable to extinction by the Worlds Conservation Union since 2007 (IUCN).
