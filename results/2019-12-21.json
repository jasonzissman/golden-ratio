In winter time, they travel further south, eating every berry in sight. This fluff ball was photographed in Stockholm a few days ago, which is pretty much as far as they will go. Some years, huge numbers goes as far as Germany though===London (and it‚Äôs surrounding counties) have a population of Wild Parakeets.

Most nests are located at the base of trees, are up to 55 cm (22 in) high in the center and 140 cm (55 in) wide at the base.===Mothers are important role models. Chicks learn what to peck, when to rest and how to behave when there is a threat. Farmed chicks are hatched in large incubators and reared artificially, without a mother hen. This makes chicks more fearful and more likely to engage in panic and feather pecking.===Arctic foxes must endure a temperature difference of up to 90-100 ¬∞C. Thus, to prevent heat loss, the Arctic fox curls up tightly tucking its legs and head under its body and behind its furry tail. This position gives the fox the smaller surface area.===The Komodo Dragons' main weapons are Its ziphodont (flat, serrated) teeth and It has a high aerobic scope for reptiles as well as unidirectional breathing (like birds). They will ambush and pursuit prey, trying to kill or hamstring with bites to the hindquarters and will attack repeatedly if needed.===Jackdaws have light irises. It has been shown these bright eyes have an important function: to warn others that a nest is occupied and to stay away. This is the first demonstration that members of the same species, outside of the primate lineage, can communicate with their eyes.===Created geckos, also known as eyelash geckos, are native to the islands of New Caledonia. They were first described by Alphone Guichenot in 1866; however, they were thought to be extinct until they were rediscovered in 1994.===The Portuguese man o' war is a siphonophore, which are colonial organisms made up of many specialized animals of the same species, called zooids or polyps. They are clustered together and different groups of polyps fulfill various roles.===Lemurs are now the most threatened mammal group on the planet, according to conservationists who issued a warning about the animals. Biologists reported last year that out of 111 known lemur species and subspecies, at least 105 ‚Äî 95 percent ‚Äî are now considered to be threatened with extinction.===Meet the rainbow white lipped python (bothrochilus albertisii), her iridescence is caused by nanostructures in her scales called iridophores, which contain microscopic that refract light as it bounces between them.===With numbers estimated from 40 to as low as 19, the Amur Leopard is the rarest cat in the world===Brookesia Micra is the world's smallest chameleon, reaching adult lengths of only 29mm/(1.1 inch).

Research has proven that these elusive pescatarians genetically differ from timber wolves. (Source: National Geographic)===American Kestrels, like few other birds of prey, have false eyes on the back of their heads.
