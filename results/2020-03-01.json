      "aggregatedTitles": "===The jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi) or eyra is a furtive, mostly diurnal, wild feline native to southern North America and South America with relatively short legs, an elongated body, and a long bushy tail. The ears are short and rounded, and its coat is without spots and uniform in color.===Sociable Weaver build the largest nest of any bird and they can house over a hundred pairs of birds. Large nesting colonies can be active across many generations, sometimes over a hundred years.===Tasmanian Devils have incredibly strong jaws. In proportion to their body weight, they have the strongest bite of any living animal. Thanks to their powerful jaws and large, sharp teeth, Tassie Devils eat nearly all of their prey, even the bones.===Spotted hyena cubs are born all black but gradually shed this 'lanugo', starting with the head and then spreading down the neck towards the back of their bodies. The rate at which the lanugo is shed can be an accurate way of aging cubs.===The Lady Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae), or rainbow finch, is a colorful passerine bird native to Australia. Interestingly, female finches are able to control the sex ratio of their offspring and reduce the rate of female offspring mortality by choosing mates according to their head color.===The reef stonefish (Synanceia verrucosa) is not only a master predator but one of the most venomous fish in the world, even lethal to humans. Its appearance is that of a crusty rock affording the fish uncanny camouflage. Each of its 13 dorsal spines has two venom sacs containing 3 deadly toxins.===When a bearded dragon headbangs, he is showing dominance.===The Spanish dancer (Hexabranchus sanguineus) is one of the largest sea slugs in the world and it can grow to 90 cm in length. Like most nudibranchs, it is brightly colored and venomous. When disturbed on the ocean floor, the slug folds its edges and undulates its body using flamenco moves to escape.===The Bagworm Moth Caterpillar Builds a Log Cabin===The ªI ªiwi (Drepanis coccinea) is a species of Hawaiian honeycreeper. The ªI ªiwi's scarlet feathers were once highly prized by Hawaiian nobility for use in decorating their traditional feather cloaks and feathered helmets. The ªI ªiwi is the third most common native land bird in the Hawaiian Islands.===The Gopher Tortoise saves hundreds of animals' lives during wildfires in the southeast USA. They dig deep burrows into elevated hills of sandy soil, and snakes, amphibians, rodents and other small mammals all crowd in for refuge during the fires===The Halloween Moon Crab is found in mangroves and sand dunes along the Pacific coast from Mexico south to Panama. It also lives in the rainforests at least some of its adult life, but needs to return to the ocean to breed. It is largely herbivorous consuming mostly leaf litter and seedlings.===Your dog's ice-cold nose may be a sensor for detecting heat at distance. Instead of detecting heat through conduction or convection, the nose might be able to directly detect weak infrared radiation released by a warm body or object through photons.===The Persian cat (Persian: ⁄Øÿ±ÿ®Ÿá ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ€å‚Äé, romanized: Gorbe ƒ™rƒÅnƒ´) is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by its round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the \"Persian Longhair\" in the English-speaking countries.===Sea angels are small, free-swimming sea slugs with wing-like flapping appendages used for locomotion. Some species of sea angels feed exclusively on sea butterflies which are extremely small, transparent free-swimming sea snails. Sea angels secrete toxic chemicals to ward off potential predators.===Livingstone's turaco (Tauraco livingstonii) is a species of bird distributed throughout the subtropical lowlands of southeastern Africa. It is easily identified by its red, white and black eye patches, dark red beak, and a bold green crest sporting white floral flourishes. It mostly eats fruits.===A juvenile Staghorn Hydrocoral settles on a shell occupied by a hermit crab. It grows into a colony, all the while exuding chemicals which erode the shell. Eventually the shell is dissolved and the hydrocoral takes up residence on the exposed carapace and abdomen of the crab. Both animals benefit.===The ManhattAnt is a unique species of ant found only in New York City. Biologists stumbled upon them in the Broadway medians at 63rd and 76th streets in 2010, and the biologists claim the ant species does not match any of the 13,000 known species. The ants subsist on a diet high in corn syrup.===Little penguins are the smallest of all penguin species. They stand approximiately 33cm tall and weigh around one kilogram, with males weighing slightly more than females.===The dark \"moustache\" below the eyes of falcons and kestrels is called the malar stripe. These darker feathers reduce glare into their eyes.===Pound for pound, the Least Weasel has the strongest bite force of any living mammal in North America (although the extinct Marsupial Lion beats it). Weasels often perform a \"War Dance\" before going after bigger prey like rabbits, in which they flail their bodies and roll around chaotically===Damselflies have smaller and slimmer bodies compared to dragonflies. When damselflies are at rest, the wings are folded alongside the body, but dragonflies hold the wings flat and away from the body. During mating, damselflies form a heart-shaped ring until the time the female deposits her eggs.===The pink-necked green pigeon (Treron vernans) is a common species of bird found in SE Asia. It lives in a wide range of forested, upland and grassy habitats. Its diet is dominated by fruit, in particular figs. It has also adapted well to human-modified habitats such as farmland, cities and parks.===The southern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome), consisting of two subspecies, is a small yellow-crested black and white penguin found on a number of sub-antarctic islands. These penguins are known to live quite long (30yrs), and currently there are approximately one million breeding pairs.===The Pig-Nosed Turtle has nostrils at the front of a protruding snout. It is the only freshwater turtle that has flippers like a sea turtle. They are mostly found in Northern Australia and Southern New Guinea.",
