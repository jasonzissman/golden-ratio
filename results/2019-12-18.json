Opting out saves money!===LPT: Whenever you’re going to a social function filled with people you don’t know, stand back, be friendly but quiet, and study the crowd. You’d be amazed at how much you can learn about people before they know you.===LPT If you see birds flocking in mass it could mean danger is heading your way.===LPT: When trying to start a notebook or journal, scribble or draw nonsense on the first page so you don’t feel pressure to make everything perfect. Just get started!===LPT: if you want your free time to go by slower, just turn on C-SPAN.===LPT: For those with unique names that people make comments about. The best way I've found to break the awkardness is to say \"Thanks, I got it for my birthday.\"===LPT: If you want to quit smoking, vaping, or drinking but can’t or don’t want to go cold turkey, replace your usual vice with a version that you hate (get Coors instead of your favorite beer, choose a sweet vape if you like tobacco flavor, etc.). This makes it easier to control the weaning process.===LPT: Record your parents/grandparents talking about photos from their childhood. This allows you to save family history, and gives you a chance to hear their voices when they’re gone.===LPT: If you are showing something on your phone to a coworker or family member, turn on airplane mode first to prevent any embarrassing notifications from popping up.===LPT: Avoid being nominated for undesirable tasks by nominating yourself for other tasks first. It's harder to force a volunteer to do something else or replace a specialist.===LPT: Free Logo Design (From Pay sites!)===LPT: When receiving a call from an unknown number, answer it and do not say anything. You will be removed from most spam call lists.===LPT: if you really want the fastest shipping, don’t use a big name delivery company, use a logistics company. They can even get your stuff delivered the same day!===LPT if you buy large items for Xmas (TV, computer cases etc) break the boxes down as small as possible and do not leave them outside. You're advertising the new things you just got.===LPT: Don't ask \"Are you visiting your family for the holidays?\" instead ask \"Do you have any plans for the holidays?\"===LPT: If you are constantly silencing and unsilencing your phone between home and work, use the Do Not Disturb feature on your phone and schedule the silencing to your work hours.===LPT: During this busy holiday travel season. After landing and entering the airport, try using a restroom further away from the terminals as they are typically less trafficked===LPT - Check with your local sanitation department to see if they offer free Trash Bin cleaning or replacements",
