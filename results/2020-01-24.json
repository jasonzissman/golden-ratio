It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===During the \"Walrus and the Carpenter\" sequence in \"Alice in Wonderland\" [1951], when the walrus speaks his bubbles are clear, but when he puffs on his cigar underwater, the bubbles he lets out are filled with smoke.===For the longest time, I never understood why the grasshoppers in A Bug's Life (1998) had a feral grasshopper amongst their ranks. Today I finally figured it out, he's a locust, a grasshopper in its crazed \"swarming\" phase===In Monsters University [2013] the claw on the statue is a lighter colour than its body from everyone touching it.===In Interstellar (2014), the shape of The Endurance space station is in reference to a clock face, with time being a major theme in the movie.===In Back to the Future Part III (1990), during the final showdown between Marty and Mad Dog, Marty's first punch is a left-handed punch, despite Marty's other punches being right-handed. This is a reference to his dad's unexpected left-handed knockout punch against Biff in 1955.===In The Dark Knight 2008, when Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) holds Joker’s mugshot from the security camera. The number displayed is the exact date when the movie was released 2008 July 18===In MIB (1997), agent J (Will Smith) spits out the lemon juice served by Edgar's wife, possibly because it was sugarless. This happens because all of the sugar was used a few scenes back to feed the alien.===In the 2002 war film We Were Soldiers, when Lt 2nd Henry Herrick dies, his pupils fully dilate. This is due to the ciliary muscles that control the constriction of the pupils no longer reviving signals from the brain.===In LOTR The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), after Boromir's death Aragorn puts on his bracers as a way to honor him. He'll wear them for the rest of the trilogy.===In The Lego Batman Movie (2017) the slide behind the police commissioner lists ninjutsu as part of the four point program===About Time (2013), Doctor Strange (2016), The Time Traveler's Wife (2009), and Midnight in Paris (2011): four movies in the ever-growing \"Rachel McAdams is romantically involved with a man who can manipulate/travel through time\" film genre.===In Shazam! [2019] early on in the film, when the two cops enter the pawn shop, you can see the Annabelle doll on a shelf! Director David F. Sandberg allowed for Annabelle to cameo in his new DC movie after director/Conjuring architect James Wan worked Annabelle into Aquaman.===In Shrek (2001), you can briefly see the arrow’s final trajectory before reaching Shrek’s butt===Near the start of Terminator 2 (1991) when the T800 leaves the bar for the motorcycle, the guy he threw through the window can be seen laying on the hood of the car.===In Aladdin (1992) Jafar steals the Sultan's ring to find the\"diamond in the rough\" for his own greed. The lie he gives is to find a suitable husband for Jasmine. He finds Aladdin===In Killer Bean forever (2009), the mafia boss cappuccino sells not only drugn and guns, but also eggs. Which is a very interesting take on an Easter egg===In \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\", John Goodman's character Big Dan is a double \"cyclops\" allusion.===6 Underground (2019) they knock out the driver mirror at the beginning of chase but they keep driving the car with the mirror then it cuts back and forth between one with it and without it.===Early in \"Local Hero\" (1983), an oil company engineer hands Mac (Peter Riegert) a model of a village and says, \"Here, hold Ferness a minute.\" When Mac tries to return it, the engineer says, \"No, take it. Keep it,\" subtly foreshadowing the feelings Mac will develop for Ferness and its people.===In \"The Last Samurai\"(2003), when Algren(Tom Cruise) fires unexpectedly asking to shoot him, everyone flinches apart from the 2 other American veterans, underlining the inexperience of Japanese soldiers.===In Hercules (1997), the medallion he receives as a baby is fitted into his belt.===In the original Ghostbusters (1984) we see Hi Ho crackers. These are the cheapest version of good crackers. Laying the foundation of how poor they were at the time.===John Wick 3(2019). John makes his way across the rooftop and stops precisely w/ you can hear a faint beeping noise in the background. Not quite a movie detail as much as a prediction that at the beginning of JW4, we see a flashback to this scene where it was a predestination.===In LOTR Return of the King (2003), we see Denethor holding Boromir's broken horn. We actually see the horn being broken after Boromir is shot by the third arrow in The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)===In the hospital scene in kill bill, during stressing moments like as when she wakes up, hearing buck enter, and hearing him paying for well, you know. You can hear her heartbeat rise and lower. (October 10th, 2003)",
