I miss that guy, but it's good to see him back. ... I love Marshawn.\"===[Rapoport] For his return to Seattle, #Seahawks RB Marshawn Lynch will make $60,588 in Week 17, plus whatever the playoff share ends up being… plus his share of online sales of “Unfinished business” and “Back in Action” apparel on his website.===[Slater] Washington HB Adrian Peterson: “People saying, ‘oh, lose because you get the best draft pick.’ No. Screw that.”===If the 49ers and Packers both win this weekend, the New Orleans Saints will be the second 13-3 team this decade to be a 3 seed in the playoffs. The other team to do so? The 2011 New Orleans Saints, who became the third seed behind the Packers and 49ers.===[Stevens] Drew Lock and Von Miller swapped jersey’s after Sunday’s game. “I just wanted a Drew Lock jersey.
