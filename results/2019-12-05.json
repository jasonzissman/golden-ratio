They will let you know if they have found one.===LPT: When seeking a new job, don't underestimate the value of the time you'll spend commuting. If you're full-time, a one-hour twice-a-day commute means you're \"working\" two more months each year!===LPT: If someone is making inappropriate jokes to you, ask them to explain it.===LPT: If you have a therapist or social worker that you would like to show appreciation for during the holidays, remember that it is against their code of ethics to receive gifts from clients. Instead, write a card that mentions one or two specific examples that they made a difference for you.===LPT If you ever forget your WiFi password or you want to get your school WiFi password etc. Just type this command into the command line of a computer already connected to that WiFi: netsh wlan show profile WiFi-name key=clear===LPT: If you think you have an Alcohol Addiction, you probably do. The best thing you can do is get it early before you start getting withdrawals. Go to rehab, meetings, detox, or talk to someone.===LPT: If you're feeling generous at the drive through, consider giving whatever your bill was as a tip to the minimum wage slaves behind the window rather than picking up the bill of the person behind you.===LPT: If you have a cat or dog, teach them to recognize treats (Shaking a bag, for example) and always reward them for coming. This can save you many worried hours of them hiding or worse, getting away outside.===LPT: Always get a 2nd opinion on anything medical before making big decisions===LPT: Skip buying inkjet printers and instead get a laser printer. They’re cheaper, a lot more reliable, and laser toner cartridges last for THOUSANDS of pages.===LPT: Create a little chant you say as you leave the house to help you remember everything. Mine is \"Got my keys, got my phone, got my wallet, doors are locked, oven's off, dog is in his crate\". Touch or look at each item as you say it. I never forgot anything!===LPT: When buying a car from a dealership (new or used) have the salesman break down the taxes and fees section. Dealerships often sneak unwanted warranties and optional purchases under \"fees\" to inflate the purchase price.===LPT: if you're planning to get in shape next year but don't know where to start, consider an annual state park pass.===LPT: Sprinkle a little salt on the center of your beverage napkin to keep your glass from sticking to it.===LPT: When someone asks you a favor (like throw out the trash, call this person, etc) and you respond by saying you'll do it later, ask yourself are you really going to do it later OR you are just lazy, don't really want to do it, and will inevitably forget it leaving the other person hanging.===LPT: Just because there is food on your plate, doesn’t mean you need to eat it all. Learning to know when you’re genuinely full vs appetite can significantly change your relationship with food/body. Mindful eating!===LPT: Make sure this Christmas you rip up and hide any boxes for expensive gifts you might get, don't become a target for thieves.===LPT : If you want to improve your eye contact with other humans, practice maintaining eye contact with characters on TV. You might be surprised how often you don't make it with people on screen.===LPT: Upload and \"share\" important voicemails from people you cherish to more than 2 platforms (email, voice recorder on phone, etc). That way if they're gone someday you will always be able to hear their voice even if you lose/switch phones.===LPT: Help a grieving friend out without imposing===LPT: treat your ears nicely. Ears don't repair themselves and earplugs to concerts are better than tinnitus for the rest of your life.===LPT: If you're lonely, get a dog. You will be out meeting and chatting to strangers in no time.===LPT: If you need a favor from someone and they text you they’ll do something about it tonight, wait until the evening to text them back “thank you” so it serves as a subtle reminder as well.===LPT- On an iPhone go to Settings&gt;Phone&gt;Silence Unknown Callers and turn this feature on to keep spam calls from interrupting your day.===LPT: If you have a facial moisturizer you don't like, try finishing it off on your elbows.",

      "aggregatedTitles": "===Important Update regarding frozen puns===In “The Goonies” (1985) director Richard Donner wanted an authentic reaction from the kids when they saw Willie's ship for the first time, so they didn't get to see it until it was time to shoot. The scene had to be reshot due to the cast swearing as part of their reaction.===In Rogue One (2016) the insignia for Galen Erso's Eadu science team (who built the exploitable flaw into the Death Star) is similar to the Rebel Alliance's animation of the Death Star exploding in A New Hope (1977).===In 'Toy Story' (1995) all of Andy's friends are duplicates of himself.===In 1982’s The Snowman, the animators added a brief shadow of a helicopter to add the perception of the shot being filmed.===In Beauty and the Beast (1991) Gaston used his bow in the final confrontation with the Beast instead of his blunderbuss, this is because it was raining and the gunpowder would've gotten wet making it useless.===In \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" (2017) Bruce Banner's picture is on the wall in Peter Parker's school along with other very famous scientists including Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton.===In Ratatouille (2007) while Remy is running through apartments in the beginning of the film, a shadow of a dog barking at him is the same shape/type as Dug from Up (2009), which did not release for another two years.===In Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith(2005) there is a small YT-1300 Corellian light freighter(Millenium Falcon) arriving on Coruscant.===In Watchmen (2009), whenever Ozymandias is in his superhero identity he speaks with a slight German accent, but when he is in public as Adrian Veidt he uses an American accent.===Conan The Barbarian (1982) Conan's memorable response to the question: \"What is best in life?..\" was taken from a book about Genghis Khan. Writer/Director John Milius was inspired by the book: GENGHIS KHAN THE CONQUEROR OF ALL MEN, written by Harold Lamb, published in 1927 (source given below)===In the movie Hook (1991), Maggie Smith - being only 56 years old at the time of filming - was aged by makeup to play 92-year-old Granny Wendy.===Quentin Tarantino uses the same shot from Inglourious Basterds (2009) when Brad Pitt unexpectedly gets tackled to the right by Nazis in Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood (2019) but this time with a hippie===In Boogie Nights (1997) Alfred Molina wore an earpiece blasting “Sister Christian” during his climatic scene in the film. As a result, unlike the other actors in the scene, he never flinches as fireworks are being set off just behind him.===In Goblet of Fire (2005), the credits say “No dragons were harmed in the making of this movie.”===In LotR Return of the King (2003) When Pippin looks in to the palantir and wakes everyone up, Gimli stays passed out from drinking too much that night. (see bottom left hand corner)===In The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Tom Hardy wore shoes that made him 3 inches taller, thus he and Christian Bale had the exact same eye level. This was done so Bane did not have to look up to Batman, which would've undermined the dynamic of both characters.===In 1977's Star Wars, Vader claims that the power of the Death Star pales in comparison to power of the force. This is foreshadowing how the force ultimately destroy the death star.===In Deadpool 2 (2018) everyone's photo posted with a knife dies later in the film, whereas Domino's (Zazie Beetz) photo is posted with a pin, who survives.===In Toy Story 2 (1999), characters from A Bug’s Life (1998) can be seen for sale in Al’s Toy Barn===In Monsters, Inc. (2001) you can see Jessie from Toy Story 2 (1999) on the table when Boo is being brought back to her room.===In The Shining (1980), Jack is clearly reading a PlayGirl magazine in the lobby of the Overlook===In The Irishman (2019) - The original shot was made with Robert moving his mouth since the beginning of the speech. They probably disliked something and changed it in post production with clippings and loops. (There are dozens of details besides the above, a nice work Netflix)===For E.T (1982) John Williams had problems with timing of the music during the recording of the finale chase, which made Steven Spielberg shut the projector and asked John Williams to record the music as he wanted it. Spielberg later edited the scenes around the recorded music.===Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) - There are a couple of not-so-subtle refferences to the original movies, suggesting that astronauts will come back to find earth taken over by apes===In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 (2011), Draco and Voldemort’s hug was not in the script, it was entirely Ralph Fiennes’ idea.",

What's more, this predator-induced 'arming' process is not a one-size-fits-all approach - they can even tailor their defensive responses to the types of predators present.===The Jaruga, the smallest lizard ever discovered===Owls' ear-like feather tufts have nothing to do with hearing; instead, these expressive tufts help owls camouflage themselves by breaking up their silhouette.===Slow Lorises Are The Only Venomous Primates===Morse code simplified===Axolotls are nearly extinct in the wild, but are bred as exotic pets and also for scientific research, due to their amazing regenerative qualities. When they are young, like my boys here, their skin is translucent and you can see their organs! They become opaque with age.===Mountain chicken frog is a species of frog found in the Caribbean islands of Dominica and Montserrat. It is one of the world’s largest frogs. The species is terrestrial and nocturnal. Unlike most other amphibians which breed in water, this species breeds in underground burrows.===Aye-ayes tap on the trunks and branches of trees at a rate of up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers. Once a chamber is found, they chew a hole into the wood and get grubs out of that hole with their highly adapted narrow and bony middle finger.===Mated pairs of birds may engage in a behavior called \"allopreening\" or mutual preening.

When there is fresh carrion, the magpies aren’t strong enough to penetrate the hide, so they let the eagles do the hard work and then they pester and distract them while they swoop in to steal the spoils.
