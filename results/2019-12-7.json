Family always wants to see pictures of stuff and they have a tendency to scroll...===LPT: Get the originals over low-fat versions of food. After taking out the fat, food tastes terrible, so the companies pump it full of sugar to make up for it. Sugar contributes more to weight gain than fat does.===LPT: Trying to cover up cigarette smoke with perfume or cologne does not work.===LPT: Always save a copy of any major repairs you have done on your car and periodically check it for recall notices. If, in the future, the issue is the subject of a recall, you may be entitled to a full reimbursement for repair costs, from the manufacturer.===LPT: If you have a sentence with two subjects, the sentence should still make sense if you remove one.

This will prevent you from saying things you don’t mean.===LPT: Want a more honest and direct answer to the questions you Google? Put “reddit” at the end of it.===LPT: People who go through hard times earn a certain edge on life.===LPT: If an individual or couple says they don't want children don't tell them how great kids are, that they will probably change their mind, etc. While it's very possible their being completely transparent, many people with fertility issues also say this because it's a much easier response.===LPT: If you’re trying to date successfully, be yourself point blank period===LPT: instead of keeping a flashlight in your car for emergencies, keep a headlamp.===LPT: If you want someone to like you; compliment them more often.===LPT: If you decorate a Christmas tree buy keychains instead of ornaments when vacationing or traveling.===LPT: Instead of saying \"Let me know if there is anything I can do for you\" when someone needs help, offer to do something concrete for them right then.===LPT: Most of your appliances have some kind of cleaning, filter changing, or maintenance that should be performed regularly, and you’re probably ignoring it.===LPT: Parents who label some gifts “From Santa”, consider making those the cheaper, smaller gifts so a less fortunate friend of your child doesn’t wonder why Santa didn’t also give them a (toy of the year).===LPT - Car Trouble?

Staying with their mother until about 2 years old, they don't hunt alone until they leave their mother===With an average length of 45cm (18in) and an average height of 30cm (12in), the Java mouse-deer is the smallest living ungulate, or hoofed mammal in the world.===Cougars have many vocalizations and they're able to purr. They're known for their blood curdling screams.===The black spiny-tailed iguana appears to eat a little bit of everything. At different stages of its life, C. similis consumes leaves, flowers, fruit, insects, spiders, crabs, fish, rodents, hatchling sea turtles, lizards and their eggs, birds and their eggs, bats, and its own eggs and hatchlings.===This is the Pangolin. They're the only mammals with keratin scales, however unfortunately due to poaching they are also the most trafficked mammals in the world.===Outdoor temperature can be determined by counting the chirps made by crickets.===If you threaten a spiny flower mantis, it will put its wings upwards to show the two eyes.===Salamander comes from the Greek word Fire Lizard, they’re nocturnal and capable of regeneration. Some of their tongues are up to 10 times their body length and some have teeth and can be poisonous.===All hamsters have cheek pouches. These large pockets can stretch all the way back to a hamster's shoulders. The primary purpose of the pouches is to carry food from place to place. Females may even carry their babies in them.===The shell of the Scaly-foot Snail or Sea Pangolin, consists of iron sulfide in the outer shell and aragonite in the innermost layer. The side of its foot is covered with iron-mineralised sclerites.===This is red wolf. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature there are only an estimated 20-30 left in the wild. They only exist in eastern North Carolina. The species was saved once and reintroduced here around 1987 and the population had grown before falling again.===Water fleas can thwart their enemies by growing defensive structures such as helmets and spines. What's more, this predator-induced 'arming' process is not a one-size-fits-all approach - they can even tailor their defensive responses to the types of predators present.===Owls' ear-like feather tufts have nothing to do with hearing; instead, these expressive tufts help owls camouflage themselves by breaking up their silhouette.===The Jaruga, the smallest lizard ever discovered===Slow Lorises Are The Only Venomous Primates===Axolotls are nearly extinct in the wild, but are bred as exotic pets and also for scientific research, due to their amazing regenerative qualities. When they are young, like my boys here, their skin is translucent and you can see their organs! They become opaque with age.===Aye-ayes tap on the trunks and branches of trees at a rate of up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers. Once a chamber is found, they chew a hole into the wood and get grubs out of that hole with their highly adapted narrow and bony middle finger.===Mountain chicken frog is a species of frog found in the Caribbean islands of Dominica and Montserrat. It is one of the world’s largest frogs. The species is terrestrial and nocturnal. Unlike most other amphibians which breed in water, this species breeds in underground burrows.===Mated pairs of birds may engage in a behavior called \"allopreening\" or mutual preening. Though this behavior helps maintain plumage, it also reinforces bonds between pairs.===silver scabbardfish are found at depths ranging from 50 to 750 m===Dragonflies and Damselflies form a heart with their tails when they mate.===Not only do Waxwings (Bohemian &amp; Cedar) look like they have bright red wax on the tips of their secondary feathers but they actually do have a kind of wax there called astaxanthin; a waxy blood-red carotenoid pigment derived from the fruit they eat.===Kidneys of cats are so efficient that they can rehydrate themselves from sea water during water scarcity===Hundreds of Lorikeet birds flock to the Weeping Boer-Bean trees in Adelaide park (Australia) to drink the fermented nectar and get very drunk, with zero hangover symptoms. It’s now classified an addiction.===The Polar Bear's stark white coat provides camouflage in surrounding snow and ice. But under their fur, polar bears have black skin—the better to soak in the sun's warming rays.",
