Griffin had a clause that grants him the option of voiding the rest of his deal if he had 6+ sacks in 2019.

Not every owner voted for it.===[Laine] The Bucs have also entertained the idea of a two-year deal with the first year guaranteed and the second year being a team option for Jameis Winston, per sources. The first year would be roughly the same as the franchise tag $27 million.===A 7th Team in the Conference Grates the Nerves the Same Way a 17th Regular Season Game does.

While the team has attempted to reassure him, Okung remains skeptical of the team's direction and his future with the team.===[Goessling] Now that Everson Griffen is set to hit free agency, we'll see if he is interested in returning to the Vikings or testing his market. Keep an eye on Seattle: Griffen could reunite with Pete Carroll (his college coach)===The past 10 years the 6th seed has been on average 0.4 wins better than the 4th seed. The 7th seed has been 0.45 wins worse.===I made a quick graphic/bracket to explain the new playoffs format and its implications/scenarios.===[Reid] We rarely get access to team interviews with draft prospects at the NFL scouting combine, but here’s a rare one from 2016 between Carson Wentz and the Eagles. Lots of great dialogue included here:===[Graziano] NFLPA player reps are scheduled to hold a conference call Friday afternoon. If two-thirds of them vote to approve the new CBA terms, then the vote is put to all NFL players. If a majority of all players approve, they have labor peace through 2029.===[Rapoport] This is probably the most consequential outcome for this year: If the players approve, two tags turn into just one. Huge news for the #Cowboys, #Bucs, #Titans and others.===[Schefter] NFL playoff structure is about to be changed.

It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===Notice: As of 2/10/2020, we are requiring sources (in comments) for trivial details.===The crocodile stunt in Live and Let Die (1973) in which Bond jumps across 3 crocodiles, was performed by a man named Ross Kananga. He owned a crocodile farm-with a “Trespassers will be eaten” sign on the fence. The films writer was so taken with Kananga that he named the villain after him.===For Robin Hood Prince of Thieves (1991) Alan Rickman was so unhappy with the 'terrible' script that he had friends help him rewrite his scenes to give him better lines. He won a Bafta for his performance===In Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) the protagonists make a stop at a \"Cactus Jack's Market\". Cactus Jack (1979) was one of the first movie roles of Arnold Schwarzenegger, alongside Kirk Douglas.===In the movie Frozen 2 (2019) my 6 year old daughter pointed out Big Hero 6 as a doll being played with!===In “Leaving Las Vegas” (1995) Nicolas Cage plays an alcoholic determined to drink himself to death.

The performance won Cage an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and a S.A.G. award.===In The Matrix Reloaded (2003), the iconic silver Cadillac CTS used in the freeway scene was not yet released to the public.===In Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) famous corkscrew jump was filmed in single shot. The original stunt driver was already left the set because of family reasons so mechanic volunteered to replace him. This was also the first stunt ever modeled by computer.===Les Miserables (2012) Bishop Myriel who helps Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) in his time of need is played by the original London musical Jean Valjean, Colm Wilkinson===In Terminator 3 (2003) when the T850 is warped back in time the area around him that heats up is sand and turns to glass which he steps on and breaks===In Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove (1964), Peter Sellers was paid $1 million for his three roles in the film, which was 55% of the film’s total budget of $1.8 million. Kubrick famously said \"I got three for the price of six\". Sellers got an Oscar nomination for his largely improvised performances.===In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) The gun that Walter Donovan (Julian Glover) shoots Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery) with is a Walther PPK. The same gun used by James Bond (the character Sean Connery is arguably most famous for)===16 June 1960- Psycho is the first American film to show a toilet on screen. It's also the first American film in which we hear a toilet being flushed.===The original voice of Nemo outgrew the role for Finding Dory (2016), but he makes a cameo as the truck driver at the end of the movie (at 3:05)===In LOTR the fellowship of the ring 2001 Gandalf's staff is actually Radagast's staff except his Crystal was taken out by Gandalf. He used it then to store his pipe until he was captured.===In Aliens (1986), the knife trick scene was originally going to be done by Bishop (Lance Henrickson) alone. Henrickson suggested to director James Cameron to have Hudson's (Bill Paxton) hand put on top of his, and Cameron agreed. Everyone on set was told about the change except Bill Paxton.===In Jurassic Park (1993), the computer text displayed upon the raptor's face represents the genetic code of a particular dinosaur characterised by A (adenosine), C (cytosine), G (guanine), and T (thymine).===In The Godfather: part II (1974) When little Vito arrives at Ellis Island, he is marked with a circled X. Ellis Island immigrants were marked with this if the inspector believed the person had a mental defect.===In Goldfinger (1964) when James Bond is being chased by Goldfinger's henchmen he releases smoke from the back of his Aston Martin DB5.

This line references Roald Dahl's other novel Matilda where the child hating character Ms. Trunchbull expresses the same sentiment.===In the movie Hackers (1995), all of the books identified by Dade at the club were real manuals. All but two, the Pink Shirt Book and the Unix Bible, were published by the DoD and were part of a set of books known as the Rainbow Series.===In Peter Jackson's 2003 LOTR return of the king, Boromir referers to his father as a noble man as we soon find out isn't true. But Jackson could not help himself in placing that statement as the actor who plays Boromir's dad is named John Noble in fact making him a noble man in at least one way.===In the Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) Ultimate Edition Michael Cassidy's character introduces himself as Jimmy Olsen to Lois Lane before he is outed as a CIA plant in West Africa. He is later identified as the codename 'Talon', which was another character in the DC universe.===In Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), the character \"Mutt\" gets his nickname from the same place Indy does.",

This mechanism has been in place for over 400 million years.===The monkey face orchid, or scientifically, the Dracula simia, is a rare orchid which is native to the tropical cloud forests of Southeastern Ecuador and Peru and likes to live in elevations above 2,000 feet. Its fragrance can described as a ripe orange scent which it emits when it blooms.===Angler fish interestingly begin reproduction with the typically larger female absorbing the smaller male into its body. The two share a circulatory system; the male receives nutrients from the female; and the male internally provides sperm to the female. One female often fuses with several males.===The maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) is the largest canid of South America. It is neither a fox nor a wolf. It is the only species in the genus Chrysocyon which literally means \"golden dog\", and it communicates mainly by scent markings and a kind of \"roar-barking.\" The maned wolf is omnivorous.===Maine Coon trivia: An average cat has 1 - 8 kittens per litter, 2 - 3 times per year. A Maine Coon in average has only 4, in rare cases more then 6 kittens per litter. By the way he is Odin, 6 years old and still a virgin.===The jaguar is the largest feline in the Americas.Black jaguars exist due to excess melanin from a genetic mutation. This mutation causes the skin and fur to contain larger amounts of a dark pigment.These types of jaguars are found in rain forest because its easier for them to blend into the shadows.===The Bramble Cay Melomys is the perhaps the first mammal to go extinct because of climate change in the modern era. Some time between 2009 and 2014 the last of this species died, probably drowning in a storm surge on an island off the coast of Australia where it had thrived for thousands of years.===Warthogs manage their ticks by having a mutualistic relationship with mongooses===Alpine stick insects can survive the formation of ice within their tissues during the winter. This can be done through the production of ice-nucleating agents in their extracellular body fluid.===The lilac-breasted roller (Coracias caudatus) is a very colorful bird widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa, and sightings have also been reported on the southern Arabian Peninsula. Most often seen in pairs, they prefer open woodland and savanna where they feed on insects and small vertebrates.===The quokka (Setonix brachyurus) is a mainly nocturnal and herbivorous marsupial endemic to SW Australia. They are known for being highly promiscuous and for dropping their joeys on the ground when threatened so they can escape danger. Quokkas then make various noises to distract their predators.===The golden wheel spider (Carparachne aureoflava) is a huntsman spider native to the Namib Desert of Southern Africa. The spider escapes parasitic pompilid wasps by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes at speeds of up to 44 turns per second. On steep slopes it can travel 1m/sec.===Bald Eagles return to their nests year after year. Both the males and females participate in nestorations, weaving large sticks into the nests' exterior. For the interior, softer, comfortable materials are selected like grass or spanish moss. These massive structures can be 5 to 6 feet in diameter.===The so-called Sunda flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus) or Sunda colugo, found throughout southeast Asia, is actually not a lemur and does not fly, but instead, it glides as it leaps between trees. The colugo can glide over 100 m with minimal loss in elevation. Colugos are generally nocturnal.===Pygmy seahorses are tiny fish that are nearly indistinguishable from their habitats due to their size and extreme camouflage. They are so well camouflaged that Bargibant’s pygmy seahorse was only discovered after a host gorgonian was collected and observed by marine biologist George Bargibant.===The rhea males are the ones that tend to the nests and chicks. When the chicks get close to hatching they start whistling. There is audio in the article where you can hear the whistling.===The Philippine sail-fin lizard's most distinctive feature in adult males is the erect sail-like crest of skin at the base of their tail, up to 8 cm high, which provides propulsion for this strong swimmer to move through the water, and it probably also plays an important role in thermoregulation.===Screech Owls rely primarily on their hearing to hunt and evade predators. This guy was able to pass his live-prey test, and was successfully released after a stay at the rehab center===Harris's Hawks are sometimes called \"Wolves of the Sky\" because they hunt in packs like wolves. Their unique social nature also means that they may nest in group units or help injured \"packmates.\"===A baby hedgehog is called a hoglet and a group is called a prickle or an array. Unlike porcupine quills, their spikes are not barbed. They are partially immune to viper venom and, on rare occasions, they might attack and eat them.",
