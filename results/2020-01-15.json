It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===In Joker (2019 )(dir Todd Philips), Murray Franklin introduces a guest on his show, an actor, called \"Ethan chase\". Ethan Chase was also the name of Zack Galifianakis' character in Due Date (2010) another movie previously directed by Todd Philips.===In Avengers: Endgame (2019) Thor only aims for the head when fighting Thanos (With Mjolnir in 3rd and 6th frame). These are all fighting scenes between Thor and Thanos.===In Avengers Endgame (2019), for a few frames profesor hulk can bee seen using a pencil to press certain buttons since using his fingers for such small switches would be impractical.===Celia calls Mike a “charmer” in Monsters Inc (2001), referencing the fact that her hair snakes are also in love with him (i.e. he’s a snake charmer).===The mise-en-scène of these two bathroom scenes in The Joker (2019) are pastiches of those from The Shining (1980). Jack Nicholson previously portrayed the Joker in Batman (1989).===In \"Unbreakable's\" (2000) memorable subway scene, the hyper-colorized clothing of the criminals in Bruce Willis' visions are meant to emulate the bright colors reminiscent of supervillain costumes.===In the Star Wars sequels, 7 (2015) and 9 (2019), you hear Obi Wan say \"These are your first steps\" and \"These are your final steps\" respectively. I noticed this continuity of the character saying \"You've taken your first step into a much larger world\" from episode 4 (1977).===In 21 Jump Street (2012), after taking the drug HFS Jenko says that it tastes like Cool Ranch. Later on, they are stopped by Mr. Walters (played by Rob Riggle) who is eating a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos, foreshadowing that he is the supplier of the drug HFS.===In Monsters, Inc. (2001), the snakes in Celia’s hair look around in alarm when she gasps.===In Terminator 2(1991), when the Nuclear bomb goes off and we see a young Sarah Connor playing with John, its actually Linda Hamiltons twin sister playing Sarah in the playground, Leslie Hamilton Gearren, who also is seen in a couple other scenes as well.===In Spider-Man (2002), Spider-Man’s hand leaves a trail of blood on the cable as he lowers it===In Shrek 2 (2004) the guards grind pepper directly on Shrek's eyes since pepper spray had yet to exist===In Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) there is a notice signed by Richard M. Nixon staring all characters and incidents are works of fiction in the film.===At the end of The Joker (2019), when the Joker takes the camera and speaks directly to the telespectator, because of the blue lighting, his costume turns to violet and his skins light blue, like the regular color pattern of the joker in the popular culture. Any idea if it was intentional? (probably)===A common plot hole in Anastasia (1997) is that Anya’s hair grows very suddenly at one point. In reality, she ties her hair into a ponytail using her own hair, meaning she always had long hair.===In Monsters’ Inc (2001) at the end of the movie where Waternoose is arrested, there are two CDA agents wearing the number 00112.===“Terminator: Dark Fate” (2019): Seconds before Grace’s arrival in the past, Sarah’s car can be seen driving on the freeway===The Looping Rollercoaster is the exact same in Rollercoaster 1977 and National Lampoon's Vacation, here's how it looks today IRL===Cars (2006) The minivan that passes Mac on the highway has its left turn blinker on as it gets into the right lane===In The Incredibles (2004). Syndrome throws Mr. Incredible on accident because he had been rehearsing his grand entrance as a superhero by tossing a fuel truck. In the former he introduces himself as Syndrome, your nemesis. In the latter as syndrome a new superhero.===In Jennifer's Body (2009), the pinball machines are \"Fire!\" and \"The Getaway\", both of which happen soon after.===In Mulan (1998), in the song I'll Make A Man Out Of You, the lines \"We must be as swift as the coursing river\", \"With all the force of a great typhoon\", \"Which all the strength of a raging fire\" are actually quotes from the book The Art of War of Sun Tzu.===In Star Wars The Force Awakens (2015), Finn's Stormtrooper Name Is the Same as Princess Leia's Cell in Star Wars: A New Hope (1977)===In Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) when the thought of defeating 7 deadly Exs comes in Scott's mind, we can see 7 \"X\" signs in the background.===In \"The Lion King\" (1994), the hyena rally during \"Be Prepared\" uses the same camera angles as actual photographs and footage from Nazi rallies.",

Despite Popular Myth, There Is No Additional Value To Them Being Male, As They Are Sterile.===In 1958, filmmakers for Disney's documentary \"White Wilderness\" imported Lemmings and staged a mass suicide - perpuating a myth that this was a common, natural behavior of the Lemmings.===Red pandas use their tails as wraparound blankets in the chilly mountain heights.===Squirrels have been observed engaging in “deceptive caching.” This is where a squirrel digs a hole and vigorously covers it up again, but without depositing the nut. It seems this is done to throw off potential food thieves.===Sword Billed Hummingbird is the only bird species with a bill length that exceeds the body length.===When an infant koala – called a joey – is born, it immediately climbs up to its mother’s pouch. Blind and earless, a joey uses its strong sense of touch and smell, as well as natural instinct, to find its way.===Hovering birds such as kestrels have an accessory optic system that is relatively several times larger than most other birds===Gannets have several important adaptations for diving; no external nostrils, air sacs in the face and chest under the skin which act like bubble wrapping, cushioning the impact with the water and forward facing eyes for binocular vision. They dive from 30 m (98 ft) up at speeds of 100 kmph (62 mph).===Although it has long been thought that reptiles lack the cognitive complexity to engage in play behavior, recent studies have suggested that reptiles from a wide variety of different taxa may benefit from toys and other environmental enrichment===Manatees aren’t endangered anymore fun fact.

Females have been proven to \"control\" their offspring's sex. If she bangs a male of a different head color, they'll produce many more sons (even if the color was painted on). That's because mating between black-heads and red-heads lead to high death rates for female babies.===Woodrats in the Genus Neotoma are native rodents of North America.
