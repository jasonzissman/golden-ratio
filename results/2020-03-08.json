It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===Notice: As of 2/10/2020, we are requiring sources (in comments) for trivial details.===Aliens (1986); Carrying the weight of a child in addition to weaponry proved too much for Sigourney Weaver, so a lookalike model of Newt was created for production. Carrie Henn did a full body cast, providing the ‚Äúbody part and the face part‚Äù, while a body double provided the legs.===In Watchmen (2009), Rorschach's mask makes a frowny face after Dr. Manhattan teleports him out of the lab.===In Men in Black (1997), actor Vincent D'Onofrio used basketball braces to create Edgar's signature walk. \"I slightly bent my legs and locked off both braces so I couldn't move either way, but it was slightly bent and I taped off both of my feet and tried to walk,\" he said.===The final scene of Street Fighter (1994) is a real life creation of their character poses from the game.===In b-movie sequel Death Race 2050 (2017), two female characters have a full conversation about the car race set in Bechdel's Bar. (Thereby passing the Bechdel test.)===In the credit scene you can see that WALL ‚Ä¢ E (2008) replaces the broken lamp with an energy-saving lamp.===One of the plot points in Megamind (2010) is that he uses a watch to disguise himself as different people. You can tell when it is him in disguise by the change in eye colour from the real person‚Äôs to Megamind‚Äôs bright green eyes.===Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)===In Casino Royale (2006), when James Bond checks his emails, most of the contacts in his inbox are the names of people who worked on the movie/worked on previous Bond movies. Full list in comments.===In Paul Blart Mall Cop (2009) Paul slaps the Observe Word everyday and it has begun to wear down over time. Which shows great accuracy the directors put in the movie===Simba's claws are extended when he climbs a branch in 'I Just Can't Wait to Be King' - The Lion King (1994)===In The Pursuit of Happyness (2006), Will Smith walked past the real Chris Gardner, the man he played and the movie was based on.===Spider-man (2002): When the spider bites Peter, the TV screen behind him list all the genetic traits of the spider. These go on to be the powers of Spider-man.===During his scene with Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver (1976), director Martin Scorcese had to sit on phone books to make himself fit in the frame for the camera for his scene===In Minority Report (2002) Tom Cruise‚Äôs character is seen on the run entering a train, where his eyes are scanned, in which a member of his team says he has been ‚Äúeye-dented‚Äù much like being ‚Äúidentified‚Äù but the process is done through the scanning of the eyes===This reference from Candyman [1992] is based on an actual murder that occurred at Cabrini Green. Link in comments.===La La Land (2016) : A song from Whiplash called 'When I Wake' by Justin Hurwitz plays in the cafe. Whiplash and La la land were both directed by Damien Chazelle and Justin Hurwitz does the music in both films.===In Midsommar (2019) Christian's breakfast pie is marked with a leaf (because it is made with pubic hair specifically for him) and his drink is slightly redder (due to the blood added to it as part of the love ritual he doesn't know about).===Once upon a time in Hollywood-2019. Technicolor is the production partner for graphics and VFX.===In Dark Waters (2019), lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) encounters \"the child who born deformed because of the C8 chemicals produced by the Dupont Industries\" Bucky Bailey in the gas station who was played by the real life Bucky Bailey.===In the movie Constantine (2005), when Isabelle leaves the room, the number on the door is 427. In Japanese it reads as \"„Åó„Å´„Å™\" (Shi-ni-na), which also means: Die===In the scene with Adolf Hitler in JoJo Rabbit(2019) you can see the entry and exit wounds on Adolf‚Äôs temples referencing to his actual cause of death. For those who don‚Äôt know, he committed suicide by taking a cyanide capsule and shooting himself in the head in an underground bunker in real life.===In Park Chan-wook's Thirst (2009), there is a brief shot at around 1:20:25 that is a clear homage to one of William Eggleston's most famous photographs, entitled The Red Ceiling===Oceans 11 (2001): ‚ÄúWell then inform Mr. Levin he‚Äôll be better off watching the fight in front of his television at home.

      "aggregatedTitles": "===The flying gurnard (Dactylopterus volitans) is a bottom-dwelling fish of tropical to warm temperate waters on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. These fish typically have very colorful and roundish wing-like pectoral fins. They also have large eyes and a covering of bony plates on their heads.===Florida Scrub-Jays are monogamous cooperative breeders that mate for life. In most birds, after the offspring leave the nest they disperse to breed on their own. In Florida Scrub-Jays, the young delay dispersal, remaining with their parents to help rear their younger siblings for the next few years.===An auk or alcid is a bird of the family Alcidae in the order Charadriiformes. Auks are superficially similar to penguins having black-and-white colours, upright posture and some of their habits. Auks are monomorphic (males and females are similar in appearance).===Red-footed boobies (Sula sula) come in various color morphs ranging from brown to white, but are all characterized by their vibrant red feet. They are the smallest species of booby.===Many frogs practice amplexus. Males hold onto a female's back to fertilize her eggs as she lays them, and will guard her from other males.===New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides) have the remarkable ability to fashion tools for use in capturing prey. They are able to cleverly capture grubs in nooks or crevices by poking a twig at the grub to agitate it into biting the twig, which the crow then withdraws with the grub still attached.===Gibbons are one of the only non-human primates which practice monogamy. Both parents play a vital role in raising of their young.===Taonius borealis is a species of deep sea glass squid found in the North Pacific Ocean. It is also called a cockatoo squid because of the angled position of its tentacles that resemble the tropical bird's crest. It has a mostly ammonia-filled body and it sometimes releases some for buoyancy.===Velvet worms are segmented panarthropods with stubby feet that subdue their prey by squirting a sticky, quick-hardening slime from a pair of glands on their heads. Once their prey is ensnared, the velvet worm bites into it, injecting digestive saliva to help liquefy the insides for easier feeding.===The red-capped manakin (Ceratopipra mentalis) is found in the tropical moist lowland forests of Central America. The bird is probably best known for the male's highly unusual and dazzling courting ritual whereby he shuffles rapidly backwards across a branch, akin to a speedy moonwalk.===A sabre-toothed cat is any member of various living and extinct groups of predatory mammals that are characterized by long, curved sabre-shaped canine teeth which protruded from the mouth even when closed. The sabre-toothed cats became extinct almost 11000 years ago.===Mayflies' adult stage do not survive for long - rarely for more than 24 hours to just a few minutes in some species.===Humpback whales use a technique called bubble netting which involves encircling schools of prey and blowing a series of bubble rings or vortex rings through the water which surround the prey, effectively trapping them into a ball so that they‚Äôre easier to capture en masse. Dolphins also do this.===The Louisiana Green Tree Frog, Hyla cinerea, has been shown to choose prey not by size, but by activity level. 90% of prey was actively pursued, while only 10% was prey that wandered within striking distance. They have also been called the \"bell frog\" because of their distinct croak. Pic by me.===The Gaboon Viper. They have the longest teeth of any snake, reaching up to 2 inches and are extremely venomous! Their bite might not kill you, but their bites are one of the most painful. They‚Äôre the fattest snake of the viper family, and have the second most venom behind the King Cobra.===The Fat Tailed Dwarf Lemur is the only primate that really hibernates. It gets ready for dry season by gorging itself and storing fat in it's tail.===Young eaglets are not able to thermoregulate until they are over about two weeks of age. Because of this, parent bald eagles will continue to brood their young after hatching. They will curl their fearsome talons to prevent any injuries to their eaglets.===The six-plumed birds of paradise, native to New Guinea, perform an impressive courtship ritual which includes preparing the stage by carefully clearing the forest floor, decorating the floor with red berries and rubbing branches with snake skin, and this is followed by an elaborate umbrella dance.===All 3 species of zebra have stripes; they must be important, but their main purpose is unclear. They may cool the zebra w/ the contrast increasing airflow; zebras indeed have more stripes in hotter climates. The complexity has also shown to confuse biting flies - which carry disease - when landing.===Little Red flying foxes like to hang in clusters, like a bunch of grapes, whereas other species of flying foxes hang separate from each other. They‚Äôre known for damaging trees as they are hanging in dense pockets across the branches and breaking them!===This long necked wierdo is called a gerenuk aka a giraffe gazelle and they have heavy butts for balance. Only the males have horns. They eat the lower part of trees beneath the giraffes and over the other plant eating mammals. They often weigh around 39 kilos (85.9 pounds)===The Araripe manakin (Antilophia bokermanni) is a critically endangered bird first discovered in 1996. It is endemic to the Araripe uplands in northeastern Brazil. It is estimated there are fewer than 700 of these birds in existence. It is easily identified by its vermilion red helmet-like crown.===Megalodon, meaning \"big tooth\", is an extinct species of shark that lived approximately 23 to 3.6 million years ago, during the Early Miocene to the Pliocene. It was formerly thought to be a member of the family Lamnidae and a close relative of the great white shark.===The semiplumbeous hawk is found in Central America and Colombia, and it often follows the large swarms of army ants that travel through tropical forests in order to capture it usual prey, antbirds, but occasionally it will feed on other small birds and bats. Its population is estimated to be &lt;10K.===The archer fish's most notable attribute is its uncanny ability to fire a \"super-soaker\" jet of water to knock down its insect prey into the water where it is quickly eaten. They can spray up to 10 ft with astonishing precision while at the same time compensating for the water refraction angle.",

(by Alex Kontorovich)===using diamond's high thermal conductivity to melt through ice===Why washing hands with soap for more than 20 seconds is important===New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides) have the remarkable ability to fashion tools for use in capturing prey. They are able to cleverly capture grubs in nooks or crevices by poking a twig at the grub to agitate it into biting the twig, which the crow then withdraws with the grub still attached.===Plane suspended in the air with equal and opposite forces===Taonius borealis is a species of deep sea glass squid found in the North Pacific Ocean. It is also called a cockatoo squid because of the angled position of its tentacles that resemble the tropical bird's crest. It has a mostly ammonia-filled body and it sometimes releases some for buoyancy.===The flying gurnard is a bottom-dwelling fish of tropical to temperate waters on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. These fish typically have very colorful and roundish winglike pectoral fins which they occasionally use for gliding above water for short distances.

Dolphins also do this.===How A Windproof, Flameless and Non Fuel \"Rope Lighter\" Works===The red-capped manakin (Ceratopipra mentalis) is found in the tropical moist lowland forests of Central America. The bird is probably best known for the male's highly unusual and dazzling courting ritual whereby he shuffles rapidly backwards across a branch, akin to a speedy moonwalk.===One of the ways beekeepers replace queen bees is by buying new ones that come in a custom made queen cage.===throwing a ball at a jet engine===Velvet worms are segmented panarthropods with stubby feet that subdue their prey by squirting a sticky, quick-hardening slime (similar to silly string) from a pair of glands on their heads.

It is endemic to the Araripe uplands in northeastern Brazil. It is estimated there are fewer than 700 of these birds in existence.
