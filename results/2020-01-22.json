Don't take unsafe shortcuts.===LPT: Never make fun of how someone walks, laughs or sneezes. It can seriously damage their self image.===LPT If you’re not great at schmoozing and networking at work, learn how to bake. Taking baking into the office is a great way to say hi and interact with people in a positive way regardless of their role and with an easy way to leave the conversation in order to share with others.===LPT: If you want to cancel an online subscription but it doesn't allow you to cancel online you can change your address to a California one and the option to do so online will become available to you due to their state law.===LPT: If you want to avoid people who normalize public shaming, don’t join any local facebook group. You think childish drama ends when you’re older? You’re in for a treat.===LPT: if your dog runs from you, if they see you running from them, instinctually most will stop and start chasing you===LPT: If you absolutely have to write down your passwords, never write down the whole thing. Only write down what you need to remember and use dots or dashes for the rest. For example, if your password is CoolGuy42069$ you could write down C•••G••4••6•$===LPT: Sign into the CVS app and turn on digital receipts to avoid receiving 10 foot receipts and wasting paper.===LPT: Make sure you take pictures of not just the people in your life but your mundane surroundings. Favorite walking path, parks, your bedroom, points of interest in your day. Places that feel most familiar and comfortable do inevitably change or end. You’ll be glad you did.===LPT: If you go to the hospital, but cannot afford the bill, you need to contact the billing department about their indigent program===LPT: Netflix turns its shows into audiobooks to give blind people context. However, this feature can be used by anybody, for instance, on the commute to work. They started on Daredevil, since it is about a blind superhero, and have added it to many others since.===LPT: If a news article gives you a paywall on a site you don't want to pay for, just right click the page and select view page source. You'll find the story after scrolling through a bit of code.===LPT: Before buying from Amazon, you can check \"fake\" reviews by ReviewMeta. \"ReviewMeta analyzes Amazon product reviews and filters out reviews that our algorithm detects may be unnatural.\"===LPT: When incorporating new habits try using the Two Day rule. A simple concept: Never skip the thing you're trying to accomplish more than two days in a row. Relying on rules frees up some mental space and tasks usually require less self-dicipline.===LPT: If you have a decision in your life you just aren't sure about, flip a coin. If you are happy with the result then choose that, but if you find yourself suddenly anxious or regretting the result you know to pick the other option.===LPT: if someone is balding, don't point it out to them, especially not in front of others. That person is very well aware of it.===[LPT] You can rename a bunch of files on Windows inside a folder by renaming the first file and then pressing the \"Tab\" key will take you to the next file in sequence to rename.===LPT: When someone asks for advice because of something a dear friend of theirs did, imagine if someone specific you love did the same to you when formulating your response===LPT: If you think a friend is struggling with a mental health issue, ask them about it. They likely will never reach out on their own.===LPT: When checking out of a hotel, leave a note in the sheets.===LPT: anyone who says to you \"if you cut me out of your life you'll be sorry\" is not worth keeping around===LPT - People will only treat you how you allow them to treat you. Allow them to treat you poorly and some will. YOU can set up boundaries at any time to create better relationships at work or in your personal life.===LPT: See a vendor van in the wild? Ask if they have any free samples===LPT - How changing my life strategy helped me fix the f* up and get out of morning depression..",

In fact, at 850,000 to one million hairs per square inch, they have the thickest fur of any mammal.===Frogs have permeable skins allowing them to both breathe and drink through their skins.===Parrotfish spend their days chomping down on coral. After they digest the coral, they poop out sand. Turns out, the majority of sand grains found on white sand beaches, such as those found in Hawaii, are actually parrotfish poop.===Planaria has the ability to regenerate it's whole body from any amputed part===Adult zebra sharks have longitudinal ridges on the body, a spotted pattern, and small eyes with larger spiracles.===The two back paws of the brown are larger than the two front paws as the brown bear often stands on its hind legs to either survey their surroundings or to get food out of higher places.===Prairie dogs have a language that's more advanced than any other animal language that’s been decoded.

A \"shrew-choo train\" if you will===When the hedgehog encounters a new scent, it will lick and bite the source, then form a scented froth in its mouth and paste it on its spines with its tongue, possibly to camouflage the hedgehog with the new scent of the area and provides a possible poison on its spines, known as annointing===Native to Australia, the echidna has spines like a porcupine, a beak like a bird, a pouch like a kangaroo, and lays eggs like a platypus.===The Golden Wheel Spider escapes parasitic pompilid wasps by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes at speeds of up to 44 turns per second.===Bower of a Satin Bowerbird. Male Bowerbirds build this to attract the female.===Grizzly bear cubs often weigh as little as one pound (or 450 grams) at birth.
