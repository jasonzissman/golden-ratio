It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===Notice: As of 2/10/2020, we are requiring sources (in comments) for trivial details.===In Back To The Future (1985), Doc Brown doesn’t immediately return from the future after dropping Marty off at home. He waits until just after Marty &amp; Jennifer’s first kiss in the new time line as it establishes they will go on to have kids, just like George &amp; Lorraine’s kiss did at the dance.===In The Emperor's New Groove (2000), the salt and pepper shakers at the restaurant are shaped like llamas.===In 'The Invention of Lying' (2009), the main character played by Ricky Gervais is named Mark Bellison. He is the first person to ever tell a lie. On his office door it says 'M. Bellison', or 'embellishing' which is another word for making things up.===In The Emporer's New Groove (2000), the menu at the restaurant is a parody of the Bob's Big Boy logo.===Knives Out (2019) Steelbook detail! Not sure if this counts, but if you get the slipcover of the steelbook flip it around, it points to a very specific character...===In the film Matrix Reloaded (2003), the candy that the Oracle eats is another red pill.===In Die Hard (1988), during the scene where John McClane (Bruce Willis) falls down a ventilator shaft, his stuntman (Keii Johnston) was supposed to grab onto the first vent. He missed. The footage was so good that editor Frank J. Urioste left it in the movie.===In Inception (2010) the architect that Dom hires to design the dream level mazes is named Ariadne. In Greek mythology Ariadne was a Cretan princess associated with mazes and labyrinths.===In Beavis and Butt-Head Do America (1996) the Peyote scene was inspired by drawings from Rob Zombie while his band White Zombie provided the soundtrack. Chris Pryonski directed &amp; animated the sequence. His studio, Titmouse, Inc., later worked on Metalocolypse, Superjail!, and the Guitar Hero games.===In Inception (2010), Ariadne draws the circular maze that gets her the job on the cover of the notepad. This is because the paper is gridded, which would trick a human into drawing a square or rectangular shape.===In ''The 40 year old Virgin''(2005), Steve Carell's chest hair was actually ripped out in the scene. The actor had told director Judd Apatow just before shooting the scene: ''It has to be real. It won't be as funny if it's mocked up or it's special effect.'' The scene had to be done in one shot.===If you go back to watch the hospital scene in The Dark Knight (2008), you'll find a heartbreaking tribute Ledger left for his daughter, where his nurse-disguise had name \"Matilda\" in the tag, his daughter's name.===(Joker 2019) Epic kiss===In Knives Out (2019), the murderer never holds an iPhone while most of the innocent characters do. Apple have a policy of not allowing bad guys to use their products.===Subliminal Christian imagery in Pearl Harbor (2001): The housewife surprised by the Japanese raid appears to \"kneel\" before the highest pole, which is shaped like a cross===In Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) the original choice to play the three gunman in the opening scene were Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach, the titular characters in Sergio Leone's previous movie The Good, The Bad and The Ugly...===In Megamind (2010) the first thing titan does when he gets his powers is flying just like Matroman===While filming The Blues Brothers (1980), John Belushi’s coke habit was so severe Universal Studios included it in the budget. Director John Landis later found “a mountain of cocaine” in Belushi’s trailer. The expense was approved so they could all work at night. Shit was behind schedule—cause blow.===In True Lies (1994), Jamie Lee Curtis tangoed so much that her quad muscles burned out and she could barely walk. In the closing credits you can see her slip, unable to hold herself up.===In the movie Take Shelter (2011), the extras at the Lions Club were told they’d get a free lunch and be in a movie. They had no idea the scene would escalate to a physical fight and psychotic breakdown===One of the last photos at the end of Hangover 2 (2011) refers to the execution photo of Nguyên Văn Lém===In Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981), the stunt involving a tanker rolling over was so dangerous that the stunt driver was not allowed to eat food for 12 hours before shooting. This was in case something went wrong and he needed to be rushed into surgery.===In Batman Returns (1992) the shadow of Selina Kyle's glasses (literally) foreshadows her transformation into Catwoman.===Interstellar (2014) did not use any green screens===In The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), when Gwen Stacy dies the clock stops at 1:21. In the comics, Gwen dies in The Amazing Spider-Man #121.",

Within minutes though, the keratin from which they are made, hardens-up and their quills become sharp like those of an adult. (Viral feeding time video in comments.)===These ethereal and ghost-like creatures are actually sea slugs—part of a large group of marine invertebrates===The rainbow grasshopper (Dactylotum bicolor) is native to the United States, Canada and northern Mexico. When threatened, it exhibits aposematism or \"warning coloration\" to mimic brightly colored stinkbugs which lizards may avoid. Studies show that birds find rainbow grasshoppers to be distasteful.===The turquoise-browed motmot (Eumomota superciliosa) is a colorful bird found in open habitats along the edges of forests extending from the Yucatán Peninsula to Costa Rica. They often perch on fences and posts scanning the fields for insects. It is the national bird of El Salvador and Nicaragua.===Siberian salamanders can survive in temperatures as low as -45°C! They use a antifreeze like chemical to help protect them.===The colorful oriental dwarf kingfisher (Ceyx erithaca) is endemic across much of the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia and is found along small streams in densely shaded forests. It feeds on a wide variety of creatures: fish, geckos, skinks, crabs, snails, frogs, crickets, and dragonflies.===Umbonia ataliba is a species of thornbug endemic primarily to mountainous areas of Costa Rica and it is usually found in more abundance ~ 1000m in elevation and above. This insect has lately drawn increased research interest because of climate change impacts on its fecundity and mating behavior.===The seven-colored tanager (Tangara fastuosa) is a vulnerable species of bird endemic to forests in north-eastern Brazil. Its colors are turquoise-green, black, bright blue, ultramarine blue, paler turquoise-blue, dark blue and orange. They are often seen in pairs feeding on berries, seeds and fruit.===The Debelius' Reef Lobster most commonly has a lavender body with violet bumpy round spots and violet claws tipped with orange stripes. They also may occur in different colors including purple, pink, orange and yellow. These lobsters are found on tropical reefs in Indo-Pacific waters.===The Imperial Tortoise Beetle (Stolas imperialis) is indigenous to Brazil and bears a striking resemblance to a turtle. They are among the most brilliantly colored among beetles, and native populations are known to use them as jewelry. They are generally less than half an inch in length.===One of the most distinctive features of the coconut octopus is its suckers. They are almost white and really stick out when the creature has assumed a darker color. The contrast in colors between its body and its suckers can create a fluorescent effect for the suckers.===The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is a large livestock guardian dog breed from the Caucasus Mountains, commonly bred in the mountainous regions of Transcaucasia, especially in Georgia.===Bald Eaglets are covered in light gray down after hatching; after roughly 3-6 weeks, their dark brown juvenile plumage will molt in. Eaglets grow rapidly and fledge from the nest in about 10-12 weeks.===The pompadour cotinga (Xipholena punicea) lives in the Amazonian rainforest and has a range that includes Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and the Guianas. These birds mainly eat fruits, and males are known to perform elaborate mating displays for the females who then raise the young alone.===The lined chiton (Tonicella lineata), found in the northern Pacific Ocean, is quite colorful, having blue, purple or black straight or zig-zag lines on each of the eight valves. It mostly feeds on coralline algae. Sea stars are among their natural predators. They grow to about 5 cm (2 in.) long.===Bearded dragons have a third eye called the parietal eye. It’s used to detect shadows and light, and can be found in other animals such as bullfrogs, anoles, sharks, and turtles.===Tree kangaroos are marsupials inhabiting the lowland and mountainous rainforests of Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and the far north of Queensland, Australia. Living up in the foliage, these species look like a cross between a kangaroo and a lemur. There are 14 known species of tree kangaroo.===Berghia coerulescens is a species of sea slug, a marine nudibranch, first discovered along the French Mediterranean coast. It also occurs in the Atlantic Ocean, from the Brittany coasts to the Canary Islands. The cerata are bright blue with yellow tips and the rhinophores orange-brown in color.===Mantis shrimps strike so rapidly that the collapsing bubbles generated produce a very small amount of light.===This brightly colored Crown-of-thorns Starfish is native to coastal areas of southeast Asia. It is a well-known coral predator, and outbreaks of tens of thousands of individuals have been known to cause serious harm to coral reefs in some areas. The thorny spines are used for defense from predators.===The Asháninka arboreal chinchilla rat (Cuscomys ashaninka) is a cat-sized mammal native to Peru. It was first scientifically described in 1999 after being found by a researcher hiking in the Vilcabamba Mountains near Machu Picchu. It is named after an ethnic group living in the Amazon rainforest.===The Venezuelan poodle moth was first brought to the attention of entomologists in 2009 after being photographed, and even now the moth remains very poorly understood.
