Yours is the power to fluently read and speak every language in the universe. At first you thought the had the worst power on earth, that was until you you realise that the universe has it's own language.===[WP] After a year that just continually got worse, you went to sleep on New Year's Eve, 2019, ready to positively face the year ahead. You woke up to find the date to be December 32nd, 2019. That was some time ago; today is December 583rd, 2019, and your sanity is starting to slip.===[WP] You are an assassin. You do not use guns, knives, or poison. You are a master of the butterfly effect and chaos theory.===[WP] You were born with a floating ethereal crown above your head. As you grew, it became visible to others and your \"commands\" became harder and harder to disobey. For the past 10 years nobody was able to refuse your orders, your word was absolute, until today.===[WP] you are a dragon. You spend your days tending to your hoard. One day you find a small human child at the mouth of your cave. He is in tears. You ask him why he's here. He tells you that he is a monster.===[WP] You last saw your wife when she left for work this morning. She just walked in the door and hugs you like she hasn't seen you for a long time. She's wearing unfamiliar clothes, her hair is longer, and you don't remember her arms having muscles. Oh, and she has a sword strapped to her back.===[WP] You have accidentally removed the seal on a demon who's been sealed for the past 1,000 years. The demon contemplates killing you and taking your soul until it sees your television and makes the decision to live with you and see the modern world in exchange for sparing your life.===[WP] \"hear me Djinn, all I want are two wishes.

This Christmas, she's back for revenge, and she will do whatever it takes to get it.===[WP] Most space fairing species are logical beings; when they learn that nothing can go faster than the speed of light they accept it and deal with that limit. The space community is then shocked when Humans, an illogical species with a strong obsession with science fiction, turn up with FTL travel.===[WP] In every house, in a wall, are curved the names of all the previous owners of the house (some sort of tradition). You don't care about it, but you've just bought a house, so you have to curve your own name. But when you see the wall, you freeze. All the names curved are the same as yours.===[WP] most of the universe utilizes teleportation to land their armies on an enemy planet, but humans, having not mastered quantum entanglement, have a primitive, but more horrifying way for the enemies to \"drop\" their troops off.===[WP] It‚Äôs an old tradition for people to get together and go door to door singing Christmas carols, and no one really knows why a tradition of spreading good will for nothing in return lost popularity; until a modern group of carollers discovers that their singing can control the emotions of others.===[WP] You're an anarchist revolutionary.

The origins of these birds are completely unknown and are entirely down to speculation. The British birds are considered a hybrid population of two Asian subspecies, P.k. borealis and P.k. manillensis===The ears in the Antelope Jackrabbit are large enough to regulate their body temperatures by expanding and contracting the blood vessels webbed throughout them.===The Climbing Perch can survive out of water for 6-10 days. Like other labyrinth fish, they possess a labyrinth organ, a structure in the fish's head which allows it to breathe atmospheric oxygen.===The bohemian waxwing lives far north in Eurasia and North America. In winter time, they travel further south, eating every berry in sight. This fluff ball was photographed in Stockholm a few days ago, which is pretty much as far as they will go. Some years, huge numbers goes as far as Germany though===This is the Trichobatrachus robustus, also known as the \"hairy frog\". It has a self-mutilating defense mechanism where it breaks his finger bones so that they protrude from the skin and create claws. This is basically the frog version of wolverine.===There is a species of octopus so cute,they considered naming it \"Adorabilis‚Äô===Wild dolphins jump regularly, scientist still don't know why===Bald Eagles may communicate through vocalizations, wing flapping, and head movements. The added flexibility of bald eagle necks--due to extra cervical vertebrae--can make their head motions rather comical.===The Akhal-Teke \"Golden Horse\" of Turkmenistan. These horses are well known for those individuals who have a golden buckskin or palomino color, a result of the cream gene, a dilution gene that also produces the perlino and cremello colors.===Komodo dragons lick their lips for 15-20 minutes after eating and rub their heads on leaves so their jaws are relatively quite clean. It's also debated whether the anticoagulant saliva is actually used as venom to kill prey. Either way, the teeth are the main weapons.===The king cobra is the only snake that builds a nest using dry leave litter, starting from late March to late May. Most nests are located at the base of trees, are up to 55 cm (22 in) high in the center and 140 cm (55 in) wide at the base.===Mothers are important role models. Chicks learn what to peck, when to rest and how to behave when there is a threat. Farmed chicks are hatched in large incubators and reared artificially, without a mother hen. This makes chicks more fearful and more likely to engage in panic and feather pecking.===Arctic foxes must endure a temperature difference of up to 90-100 ¬∞C. Thus, to prevent heat loss, the Arctic fox curls up tightly tucking its legs and head under its body and behind its furry tail. This position gives the fox the smaller surface area.===The Komodo Dragons' main weapons are Its ziphodont (flat, serrated) teeth and It has a high aerobic scope for reptiles as well as unidirectional breathing (like birds). They will ambush and pursuit prey, trying to kill or hamstring with bites to the hindquarters and will attack repeatedly if needed.===Jackdaws have light irises. It has been shown these bright eyes have an important function: to warn others that a nest is occupied and to stay away. This is the first demonstration that members of the same species, outside of the primate lineage, can communicate with their eyes.===Created geckos, also known as eyelash geckos, are native to the islands of New Caledonia. They were first described by Alphone Guichenot in 1866; however, they were thought to be extinct until they were rediscovered in 1994.===The Portuguese man o' war is a siphonophore, which are colonial organisms made up of many specialized animals of the same species, called zooids or polyps. They are clustered together and different groups of polyps fulfill various roles.===Lemurs are now the most threatened mammal group on the planet, according to conservationists who issued a warning about the animals. Biologists reported last year that out of 111 known lemur species and subspecies, at least 105 ‚Äî 95 percent ‚Äî are now considered to be threatened with extinction.===Meet the rainbow white lipped python (bothrochilus albertisii), her iridescence is caused by nanostructures in her scales called iridophores, which contain microscopic that refract light as it bounces between them.===With numbers estimated from 40 to as low as 19, the Amur Leopard is the rarest cat in the world===Brookesia Micra is the world's smallest chameleon, reaching adult lengths of only 29mm/(1.1 inch). They are only found on one small island in Madagascar, and were discovered in 2012.===The Bar-Headed Goose, native to Asia, can fly thousands of metres in the air during their migrations across the himalayas.===American Kestrels, like few other birds of prey, have false eyes on the back of their heads. Though these deter predators, they may also prevent prey--like songbirds--from engaging in mobbing behavior.===Unlike their mainlander cousins, coastal wolves on B.C.‚Äôs outer islands have a diet that is 90% seafood, including salmon, clams and mussels. Research has proven that these elusive pescatarians genetically differ from timber wolves. (Source: National Geographic)",
