Ed tells him he's only \"got Henry\" (an eighth) left for himself. Noel later complains on the phone during Shaun's team meeting that his hookup only \"got Henry\" and none to sell.===In Tommy Boy (1995), Rob Lowe appears un-credited despite having a large role in the film.

      "aggregatedTitles": "===This long necked wierdo is called a gerenuk aka a giraffe gazelle and they have heavy butts for balance. Only the males have horns. They eat the lower part of trees beneath the giraffes and over the other plant eating mammals. They often weigh around 39 kilos (85.9 pounds)===The archer fish's most notable attribute is its uncanny ability to fire a \"super-soaker\" jet of water to knock down its insect prey into the water where it is quickly eaten. They can spray up to 10 ft with astonishing precision while at the same time compensating for the water refraction angle.===Golden eagles that live in the western continental U.S. tend to remain in their ranges year-round which generally means they have to manage to survive sometimes long and harsh winters. They will often return to their frozen prey during such times to feed if fresh prey is not readily accessible.===A shark rides the wave in to grab a fish on the beach, and has to \"sand swim\" back to the surf. Sharks have amazing abilities to sense for food, even on beaches, and then return to water when stranded on land, and they also have a good sense of direction as well.===Nursery Web Spiders build cozy web-homes for their offspring, like this one built around several large leaves. Female Nursery Webs, like lots of spiders and their cousins, also tend to kill the males around mating time - to get around this, the guys play dead!===The southern ground hornbill is a large predatory bird from South Africa. These birds live in open woodland, savannah, and grasslands. They eat insects, amphibians, mammals, birds, and reptiles and are large enough to eat hares and chase eagles away from prey!===The umbrellabird is a large, tropical species of bird found in the rainforests of Central and South America. Its most distinctive feature is the inflatable wattle on its neck which serves to amplify its loud, booming calls. The male flares its crest into the shape of an umbrella during courtship.===The sarcastic fringehead (Neoclinus blanchardi) is a very bellicose saltwater fish that can open its mouth widely and use it as an assault weapon when engaging in territorial battles. They joust by pushing their distended mouths against each other, as if they were kissing, to determine dominance.===The bones of chameleons can glow through their skin for animals with UV-sensitive eyes===The broad-striped Malagasy mongoose (Galidictis fasciata) is native to the eastern forests of Madagascar. Their main distinguishing factors are their dark horizontal stripes and long bushy tails. Their primary prey is small rodents and they are mostly active in the evening and at night.===The golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) is one of the best-known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere. It is the most widely distributed species of eagle. Like all eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae. These birds are dark brown, with lighter golden-brown plumage on their napes.===The bald eagle is a bird of prey found in North America. A sea eagle, it has two known subspecies and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle. Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico.===The largest cave fish in the world were recently discovered by biologists in the Chympe Cave in India. They have primarily subsisted on bat guano which falls into the pools from above. The fish weigh about 2 lbs and measure 13 in on average, making them 10x the size of previously known cave fish.===The blue-capped ifrit (Ifrita kowaldi), native to New Guinea, is among a small group of bird species that are poisonous. They excrete batrachotoxin into their feathers and skin in order to defend themselves against predators. The poison is derived from the bird's diet of certain types of beetles.===nother fun fact about alpaca (and llamas) is they have no upper teeth- they have what we call a grazing pad where they grind they’re food against the pad with their bottom teeth and digest it!- source is me a trainer and multiple fair first place winner for 5+ years?===A tigers skin and fur are both striped===Rats are very intelligent and can experience a range of emotions. Scientists have found that, when offered a variety of food choices but only allowed to choose one, rats can feel regret upon making the “wrong” choice.===White-browed tit-warblers are incredibly small, incredibly colored birds that live in central and southern Asia. They are believed to practice cooperative breeding, in which not only parents care for their young but also a team of other birds. These birds are called helpers.===The pearly razorfish (Xyrichtys novacula) has the remarkable ability to escape predators by diving headfirst into the sand in a split-second breath-taking maneuver. It can also use its razor-sharp teeth to cut fishing line and netting by rotating its jaw to more than 90° to clip any entanglement.===The hairy snail (Trochulus hispidus) is a terrestrial, air-breathing gastropod indigenous to Europe. These hermaphroditic snails use harpoon-shaped \"love darts\" before mating for the purpose of sexual selection. Hairy snails are known to crawl into the plumage of some bird species to over-winter.===Mongoose lifespans can be long; one female dwarf mongoose in Serengeti National Park lived 13 years. In practice, however, few animals in the wild live out their natural life span, and only 25 of 846 dwarf mongooses in the same study attained their 7th birthday.===The jaws of a jaguar are stronger than any other species of cat. With these strong jaws, they will crunch down on bones and eat them. Their jaws are strong enough to crack a sea turtle's shell.In fact, in the zoo, bones are part of a jaguars' regular diet.===Melibe viridis is a species of deep-water walking sea slug which interestingly uses an expandable oral veil to scan for prey as it moves along the bottom. When the sensitive papillae detect a crustacean, its usual prey, the inner edges of the veil quickly encapsulates it like a fishing cast net.===Meerkats are a type of mongoose that live in burrows in Africa. Remarkably social, they live in groups that can number up to 30 individuals (called mobs) that cooperate in keeping watch over their young. Interestingly, when females reach sexual maturity, they are usually banished from the family.===The great horned owl has one of the most iconic hoots; its calls are often used in pop culture media. Even though the female great horned owl is larger than the male, the male has a larger voice box and a deeper voice.",

This mom with her calves is a good example.===Reload animation for a naval breechloader===Up close with a humpback whale===Pistol Shrimp use their specialized claws to produce a \"bullet bubble\" that stuns their prey.===The sarcastic fringehead (Neoclinus blanchardi) is a very bellicose saltwater fish that can open its mouth widely and use it as an assault weapon when engaging in territorial battles. They joust by pushing their distended mouths against each other, as if they were kissing, to determine dominance.===A clever shark rides the wave in to grab a fish on the beach, and has to \"sand swim\" back to the surf. Sharks have amazing abilities to sense for food, even on beaches, and then return to water when stranded on land, and they also have a good sense of direction. Sharks are actually quite smart.===The umbrellabird is a large, tropical species of bird found in the rainforests of Central and South America. Its most distinctive feature is the inflatable wattle on its neck which serves to amplify its loud, booming calls. The male flares its crest into the shape of an umbrella during courtship.===The archer fish's most notable attribute is its uncanny ability to fire a \"super-soaker\" jet of water to knock down its insect prey into the water where it is quickly eaten. They can spray up to 10 ft with astonishing precision while at the same time compensating for the water refraction angle.===Golden eagles that live in the western continental U.S. tend to remain in their ranges year-round which generally means they have to manage to survive sometimes long and harsh winters.
