Even after fledging, family groups of black vultures remain in close contact by feeding and roosting together, and they will aggressively chase off non-family members.===An owls eyes are so big if we had the same size proportion we’d have softball sized eyes. A special ridge of bone supports them but it means they lack muscle to move their eyes. So they developed the ability to turn their head approximately 270 degrees to make up for this.===The highland cow of Scotland has an unusual double coat of hair. On the outside is the oily outer hair—the longest of any cattle breed—covering a downy undercoat. This makes them well suited to conditions in the Highlands, which have a high annual rainfall and sometimes very strong winds.===An adult North American porcupine has about 30,000 quills that cover almost all of its body. The quills are hollow and used primarily for defense, but also serve to insulate their bodies during winter.===As soon as baby Komodo Dragons hatch, they will run away and climb up trees to avoid being eaten by their mother or other Komodos.

The males have extremely black feathers which can absorb 99.95% of light. This is actually because the structure of the feathers is different, not the colouring.===Pseudocheirus occidentalis, the ringtail possum (shown here) only acts somewhat similarly to its distant relative, Didelphis virginiana, Virginia opossum (being native to eastern and southern North America). Rinngtail possum live in Australia and are closer related to kangaroos.===The African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) is not closely related to the African bush elephant; genetic studies suggest that its closer relatives were the extinct Eurasian straight-tusked elephants, called Paleoloxodon antiquus - which would invalidate both genera as we know them.===The avian magnetic compass of the robin uses vision-based magnetoreception, where its ability to sense the magnetic field of the earth for navigation is affected by light entering its eyes. This physical mechanism is not fully understood, but may involve quantum entanglement of electron spins.===All of the wingless ants you ever see are female. The male's life is but a blip- only used for mating, and he dies within minutes once the deed is done. All that prospers are empires of women in the ant universe.===Dingoes can range in color from golden, tan, and ginger, to black and cream. These colours are found among pure dingoes, but can vary more when interbreeding with dogs takes place. And their coats don’t produce the typical “dog smell.”===Horned lizards not only have tough skin and sharp plates around their neck to stop them from becoming coyote snacks. They also have the amazing ability to deter predators by squirting blood from their eyes into an attacking predator’s face.===The common hippopotamus can reach upwards of 3,000 kg, whereas the diminutive pygmy hippopotamus rarely tops 300 kg. The hippos are so distinct that the species are two different genera.===White tailed shrew mothers are known to form \"tail trains\" to lead their babies along more easily===Blue tongued skinks can get up to almost 600mm and can often be found in and around gardens.

All in all, Radin explains, \"there are only about 115 left in the wild, all of which are found in Queensland, Australia.\"===Unlike most other waterfowl Bufflehead Ducks don't nest on the ground but high up a tree. They've evolved to have the size of a crow with a comparatively big head (hence buffalo head) to fit nicely in the nesting cavity of a Northern Flicker or Pileated Woodpecker.===The Saigas eat several species of plants, including some that are poisonous to other animals. Their mating season starts in November, when stags fight for the acceptance of females. The winner leads a herd of five to 50 females. They are found mainly in Russia, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan.===The axolotl salamander has the rare trait of retaining its larval features throughout its adult life. This condition, called neoteny, means it keeps its tadpole-like dorsal fin, which runs almost the length of its body, and its feathery external gills, which protrude from the back of its wide head.===Do you know about Indian Muntjac Deer?
