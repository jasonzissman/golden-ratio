Whilst all of the family guesses a Spanish speaking country Ransom Drysdale guesses Portuguese speaking country.===In Kung Fu Panda (2008) during their fight, Shifu doesn't attack Tai Lung until he grabs Master Oogway's staff from his shrine: this makes Shifu angry enough to stop trying to talk Tai Lung down and start fighting back===In The Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies (2014), the Elven heirloom of Greenwood is named as White Gems of Lasgalen.
