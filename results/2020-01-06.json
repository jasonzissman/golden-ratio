      "aggregatedTitles": "===Rules simplification===Stop posting the 'Do not shorten 2020' tips, we've had it 75 time's in the past three days. The first time was enough.===LPT: You can access most MIT courses for free online===LPT: If you are in a position to foster the culture in a company, try to encourage employees to utilize sick time without fear of repercussion. Employees working while sick is counterproductive on various levels: spread of illness, burnout, lower productivity.===LPT: Depression doesn't mean that the affected person will never laugh, so if you know somebody to be depressed and they laugh, do not assume their depression has been cured. Keep supporting them.===LPT: When interviewing for a new job make sure to use the employee restroom before you leave. The conditions of the restroom say a great deal for how the company treats their staff.===LPT: Dont go to Claire's for ear piercings, go to a Tattoo/Piercing Shop. Piercing guns cannot be sterilized.===LPT: If you are flying with someone make sure to divide your clothes===LPT: Do not be intimidated by tailgaters and speed up, they will only keep up. Maintain a greater distance between you and the vehicle ahead of you to compensate for the lack of safety distance behind you. This will give both vehicles more time to react to emergencies.===LPT: If you have a hard time controlling late night food cravings, brush your teeth when you want to be done eating for the night. If you eat, you'll have to brush your teeth again. Hopefully your laziness outweighs your desire to eat.===LPT Melamine sponges are way cheaper on Amazon or eBay than the equivalent name brand, Magic Eraser, and cleaning your shoes is way cheaper than buying new shoes. This sub doesn't allow pics, but I posted a pic in r/frugal to show how minutes of work got rid of years of grime.===LPT: When making grilled cheese, try using garlic butter instead of regular butter. It'll jazz up your sandwich and give it some interesting flavors.===LPT Set your stopwatch to 10 minutes and clean up around your room/house. You will be amazed at how much you can accomplish in that amount of time and how much better it feels when your space is tidier===LPT: Sharpie is alcohol-based, which means that using isopropyl alcohol, you can remove it from non-porous surfaces===LPT: if you think you‚Äôre having fun because you‚Äôre drunk, reevaluate the situation: you‚Äôre probably having fun because you‚Äôre in an upbeat social setting. Having a few drinks to loosen up can actually make you have a better overall time than getting hammered, and you‚Äôll feel better the next day too!===LPT: Never let pride get in the way of your need to ask for help. Everyone needs help sometimes.===LPT: if you dedicate 10 minutes per day to self-improvement or new skill adoption, that‚Äôs approx 1% of your day, which is enough to cumulatively have major impact over time===LPT: Telling your friend \"say hi to *significant others name* for me!\" is a simple thing, but goes a long way to letting them know you approve of their relationship.===LPT: If you need a specific font, don't buy it, it is on Github ready to download for free===LPT: If you are an expectant father then look up resources aimed at mothers rather than fathers===LPT: When shopping for something, prior to looking at its price, ask yourself ‚ÄúHow much would I pay for this?‚Äù===LPT: If videoing at a family birthday party, film more than just the birthday person. They will be interested in those who have passed more than the gifts they got.===LPT - In case you ever need to know which side of a boat is port and which is starboard, remember this...\"There is plenty of PORT LEFT in the bottle.===LPT: Before leaving on a work trip or vacation, wash and put away all your dirty clothes, and wash and gas up the car(s) so you have less to worry about when you get back.===LPT: If you browse redditp.com rather than reddit.com the subreddit you are browsing will turn into a slideshow.===LPT: Instead of saying \"I don't drink or don't smoke\" say 'I stopped drinking or smoking' people will force you less to do that and will appreciate your decision of stopping.===LPT: If you are a first responder in a crowded space, point to an individual and tell that person specifically saying \"Call 911\" as opposed to shouting these words.",

It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===Titanic - 1997 The couple shown in bed together having accepted their fate is Isador and Ida Straus. They were the co owners of Macy‚Äôs. Ida refused to leave his side when he refused a life boat spot b/c there were still women and children on board. They were last seen walking arm and arm together.===A very minor Empire Strikes Back(1980) detail I find hilarious is how among all the scratches and dents and other damage on Boba Fett's armor, there is a very noticeable chip on his, um, \"cup\" for lack of a better term. Which means someone has canonically shot Boba Fett in the crotch at some point.===In The Return of The Jedi (1983) you can spot a soldier that has a resemblance to Rex from clone wars. It was confirmed that he fought in the battle of Endor.===In Iron Man (2008) Obadiah tells Tony that the arc reactor is his 'ninth symphony.' In the classical music world, there is a belief that after a composer writes their ninth symphony they would die. He was implying that the arc reactor would be the last thing Tony created before Obadiah kills him.===In The Shining (1980), Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) wiggles his finger when his ‚Äúalternate personality‚Äù Tony speaks through him. This concept was actually thought up by Danny, who did it in his first audition for the part at the age of 4===In IT Chapter 2 (2019) Stanley‚Äôs head turns into a spider which looks exactly like the Spider Head in John Carpenters The Thing. Also, an actor from The Thing played Stanley‚Äôs character in the IT Miniseries.

John sees it later that night when he undoes it from her wrist sending Hans Gruber plummeting from the Nakatomi Plaza.===In Michael Jackson's Moonwalker (1988) the criminal drug dealer is named Frankie Lideo, a subtle nod to the movies director and Michaels then manager Frank DiLeo. DiLeo also played the gangster Tuddy Cicero in Goodfellas (1990)===In Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992), you can see the scar on Harry's hand from the door handle in the previous film.===In \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" (2003) the giant eagle that saves Frodo &amp; Samwise, as originally described in J.R.R.

The pub's plackard depicts a large eagle carrying a boy.===In Star Wars: Episode V ‚Äì The Empire Strikes Back (1980), by Irvin Kershner, while Chewbacca is looking for C-3PO in Bespin, you can spot an IG-series droid dismantled, BUT ALSO you can see Ugnaughts working with droid parts.===In Killing Hasselhoff (2017), guests at David Hasselhoff's party are shown next to a very large replica of Hasselhoff. The replica was made for some visual effects in The Spongebob Sqaurepants Movie (2004), which Hasselhoff choose to keep after being offered to by the crew when filming ended.===In Predator (1987), we never actually see Arnold Schwarzenegger's Dutch running. This is because during the creation of the film, he was infact too big to run, therefore forcing the producers to improvise.===In the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy (1999 - 2002 - 2005) Battle Droids are shot/sliced in their chest region, even after what would be a fatal injury, suggesting their power source is located there.===In Tangled (2010), in 3 seconds we get a foreshadowing of the adventures Rapunzel will have once leaving her tower. The horse (Max), Duck (Snuggly Duckling Inn), (out of frame) a cupid that basically represents Shorty, chameleon (Pascal) and a Bird (the birds that surround her when she's free)===The only time we see Gollum standing fully erect is once he claims back The Ring.

Another Brick in the Wall pt. 2 from The Wall is also featured in the New Mutants trailer===Iron Man (2008)- You can see the original version of Dum-E in a newspaper article, built when Tony was just 17.===In Parasite (2019) Park Dong-ik, when talking about the housemaid who had just been fired, says that \"She always ate enough for two\". As we discover later in the movie she was in fact stealing food for her husband who was living in the basement.===So a minor continuty error in A Goofy Movie (1995) Goofy gets launched in the sky while his shoes stay on the ground. In the air he has no shoes then when he is in the roof his shoes are back.===SPOILERS In Interstellar(2014), you can see four perpendicular lines originating from the same point inside the 4-dimensional tesseract library. Fourth perpendicular line is time-line that Cooper can move across===In 2019's JOKER during the scene when Arthur and Penny are dancing there is a television on in the background that list \"Writen By\" credits as they scroll down.
