He only agreed to this role because he got to kill Nazis, rather that portray one.===In Escape From L.A. (1996), actor Kurt Russel practiced playing basketball in between scenes because he wanted to legitimately make every shot during the basketball challenge. He made every shot, including the full court one.===Where Dr.Facilier's shadow touches the wallpaper, it turns to crossbones (The Princess and the Frog [2009])===Alien 3's (1992) production and theatrical cut was disliked by director David Fincher so much that in his later film Fight Club (1999) members of Tyler's gang demagnetize the VHS tapes in a video store, beginning with an entire row of Alien.===In Duel (1971) the young director Steven Spielberg can be seen reflected in the telephone booth during the scene where David Mann is calling the police.===The character \"Forky,\" from Toy Story 4 (2019), was originally named \"Fork Face\" by the director's young son.===In the Return of the King (2003), Gandalf brought 3 eagles with him because he believed Smeagol wasn't beyond redemption===In Dirty Harry: The Dead Pool (1988) Jim Carrey's character is making a music video where he's lip-synching to Guns N' Roses \"Welcome to the Jungle\". Later, members of Guns N' Roses are present at his funeral.===In the closing titles for 'The LEGO® Movie 2: The Second Part' (2019), which celebrate unity and the value of bringing two opposing sides together, LEGO versions of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton can be seen.===In Flushed Away (2006) a section of Rita's house structure contains a newspaper that reads 'Mysterious \"Veggie Monster\" [unreadable] local gardeners'. This is a reference to the events that unfolded in Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005)===In Saving Private Ryan (1998) during the D-day scene one of the medics (far left) gets shot through his canteen, he immediately reacts and begins to treat his injury.===In Paddington 2 (2017), Kilmainham Gaol (jail) serves as the filming location when Paddington goes to prison. Kilmainham is Ireland’s most famous jail as well as a national monument.===In The Dark Knight Rises (2012), during the first appearance of Batman's flying vehicle, if you look closely it resembles the signature 'white eyes' that Batman has in the comics===In Avatar (2009) the Na'vi only have eight fingers and eight toes but the avatars have ten and ten, because they are part human DNA===In the Cars (2006) universe, instead of Stone Henge there is Cone Henge.===In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009), the spell books on the shelves in Dumbledore's office are actually Yellow Pages covered with old-looking bindings.===At the beginning of Us (2019) at the scene showing the Hands Across America Commercial there is a yellow VHS of a Movie called C.H.U.D.

One of is labeled \"J Wan\". This is a reference to James Wan, with whom Leigh Whannell, the film's writer and director, co-created the 'Saw' franchise.===In Superbad (2007), the lead characters’ names Evan and Seth are named after the movie’s writers, Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg, who wrote the first draft of the script when they were 13 years old",

      "aggregatedTitles": "===Warthogs manage their ticks by having a mutualistic relationship with mongooses===The jaguar is the largest feline in the Americas.Black jaguars exist due to excess melanin from a genetic mutation. This mutation causes the skin and fur to contain larger amounts of a dark pigment.These types of jaguars are found in rain forest because its easier for them to blend into the shadows.===The quokka (Setonix brachyurus) is a mainly nocturnal and herbivorous marsupial endemic to SW Australia. They are known for being highly promiscuous and for dropping their joeys on the ground when threatened so they can escape danger. Quokkas then make various noises to distract their predators.===The golden wheel spider (Carparachne aureoflava) is a huntsman spider native to the Namib Desert of Southern Africa. The spider escapes parasitic pompilid wasps by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes at speeds of up to 44 turns per second. On steep slopes it can travel 1m/sec.===Bald Eagles return to their nests year after year. Both the males and females participate in nestorations, weaving large sticks into the nests' exterior. For the interior, softer, comfortable materials are selected like grass or spanish moss. These massive structures can be 5 to 6 feet in diameter.===The lilac-breasted roller (Coracias caudatus) is a very colorful bird widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa, and sightings have also been reported on the southern Arabian Peninsula. Most often seen in pairs, they prefer open woodland and savanna where they feed on insects and small vertebrates.===Pygmy seahorses are tiny fish that are nearly indistinguishable from their habitats due to their size and extreme camouflage. They are so well camouflaged that Bargibant’s pygmy seahorse was only discovered after a host gorgonian was collected and observed by marine biologist George Bargibant.===The so-called Sunda flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus) or Sunda colugo, found throughout southeast Asia, is actually not a lemur and does not fly, but instead, it glides as it leaps between trees. The colugo can glide over 100 m with minimal loss in elevation. Colugos are generally nocturnal.===Fact: One of the most dangerous animals on earth. But when little, hella cute===The Philippine sail-fin lizard's most distinctive feature in adult males is the erect sail-like crest of skin at the base of their tail, up to 8 cm high, which provides propulsion for this strong swimmer to move through the water, and it probably also plays an important role in thermoregulation.===The rhea males are the ones that tend to the nests and chicks. When the chicks get close to hatching they start whistling. There is audio in the article where you can hear the whistling.===Screech Owls rely primarily on their hearing to hunt and evade predators. This guy was able to pass his live-prey test, and was successfully released after a stay at the rehab center===Harris's Hawks are sometimes called \"Wolves of the Sky\" because they hunt in packs like wolves. Their unique social nature also means that they may nest in group units or help injured \"packmates.\"===A baby hedgehog is called a hoglet and a group is called a prickle or an array. Unlike porcupine quills, their spikes are not barbed. They are partially immune to viper venom and, on rare occasions, they might attack and eat them.===Spotted Hyena milk has the highest protein and fat content of any terrestrial carnivore.===Honduran white bats (Ectophylla alba) or Caribbean white tent-making bats, create their own daytime sleeping quarters by using their teeth to cut the ribs of large leaves causing them to fold down to form a tent. They appear as white puffballs when they gather in groups. The bats mostly eat figs.===The fire-tailed titi monkey (Callicebus miltoni) was discovered in 2011 by a Brazilian primatologist in a small sliver of lowland rainforest south of the Amazon River. Since they are unable to swim or cross mountainous terrain, the monkeys are essentially confined to very small geographical area.===Pink-necked green pigeons are incubated by both parents for 17 days. They leave the nest 10 days after hatching, but continue to be fed by their parents for a few days until independent.===The rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta) is a threatened species of lizard primarily found on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, shared by the Republic of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Its name derives from the bony-plated pseudo-horn on its head which resembles the horn of a rhinoceros.===The Pinocchio lizard (Anolis proboscis) was first discovered in 1953 in Ecuador (only a single male specimen) and it wasn't until 2004 that more lizards were found. It is critically endangered and inhabits a very small sliver of forest habitat in the Chocó where it resides high in the tree canopy.===The trunk is used to drink, smell, pick up food, touch and communicate - this baby elephant is discovering their trunk===Birth of an octopus: Female octopuses lay their eggs and painstakingly weave them together into strands or clumps. They are very doting mothers and often guard the eggs for weeks, months and sometimes as long as a year.===The small elephant hawk moth (Deilephila porcellus) gets its common name for the caterpillar head's resemblance to an elephant's trunk. Hawk moths are also known as sphinx moths because the caterpillar resembles the Great Sphinx of Giza when resting. They are found in Europe and northern Africa.===This is the Japanese raccoon dog, also known as a Tanuki in Japanese. It is sometimes classified as its own species due to unique features absent in mainland raccoon dogs.===Four new species of epaulette walking sharks were recently discovered off the coast of Australia and Papua New Guinea which are able to travel short distances over land because of their ability to walk using their pectoral fins and live in low to no oxygen conditions for extended periods of time.",
