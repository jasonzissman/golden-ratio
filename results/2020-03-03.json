It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===Notice: As of 2/10/2020, we are requiring sources (in comments) for trivial details.===At 400 pounds, standing 16 feet high, and with an arm span of 23 feet, the skeleton created for Kubo and the Two Strings (2016) is believed to be the largest, most complicated stop-motion puppet ever built.===Mia and Tia are named as such because they are modelled after the Mazda Miata (Cars, 2006)===In Frozen(2013) the Duke of Weselton is mistakenly called Weaseltown. In Zootopia(2016) Duke Weaselton is mistakenly called Weselton. Both were voiced by Alan Tudyk.===In Guns Akimbo (2020), when Daniel Radcliff looks at his ex-girlfriend the light orbs in the background form hearts because he's still in love with her.===In Enchanted (2007) the troll that chases Giselle at the beginning of the movie is wearing a loin cloth made up of the peasant dresses from previous Disney Princesses===In Avengers (2012), When Tony is Struck by Thor’s Lightning, JARVIS tells that his power is over 400% capacity. This makes sense, since Tony learnt from his encounter with Ivan Vanko, AKA, Whiplash in Iron Man 2 (2010)===In Big Hero 6 (2014), the movie takes place in San Fransokyo: A combination of San Francisco and Tokyo. In our world, the Pacific Ocean is slowly shrinking because the sea floor is folding under itself meaning that in millions of years, Japan and California can collide and create San Fransokyo.===For Thunderball (1965), Sean Connery insisted on a plexiglass corridor in the shark pool. However, the set designer didn’t have enough plexiglass to cover the whole pool and a shark got through. Connery was almost bitten. He fled from the pool.===In Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), the villainous Immortan Joe is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who also played Toecutter in Mad Max (1979).===Avengers (2012) references a deleted scene in The Incredible Hulk, where he tries to commit suicide. This scene was thought to be too graphic for the PG audience they were looking for, so it was scrapped===In of of my major childhood Spider-Man (2002), Spider Man Drops Mary Jane off on top of a Building with a little pond and a stone frog. Jump 2 decades years later in Daredevil (2015) and it's the exact location that Kingpin and his wife are sharing a moment together===In Pokémon: Mewtwo Strikes Back - Evolution (2019), Raymond’s Golem is replaced by a Drowzee. This is likely due to the Thunderbolt ending, which knocks out Golem in the original, who should be immune to due to being part-ground.===Unbreakable (2000) features a newspaper clipping with a typo. It says “Kills all expect newborn” instead of “except newborn.”===In The Thing (1982) before the dog goes into the dorm room you see a shadow on the wall. This was supposed to be Palmer, but since David Clennon's silhouette was too distinct, stunt coordinator Dick Warlock was used instead.===If you've seen 2005 Hostel (2005), you'll remember the gruesome Museum of Torture. This is the real Museum Tortury, in the town of Cesky Krumlov, Czechia, where much of the film was shot (though the film shows a more photogenic, and creepy, entrance).===In 2019's \"Knives Out\", you can hear the antagonist inside the internal monologue of the protagonist. (Explanation in comments)===During a car chase in 1992's Basic Instinct, an SUV is briefly seen with a license plate referencing Back to the Future. (The actual BttF plate reads \"OUTATIME\" however.)===In D3: The Mighty Ducks (1996) the woman who was the Ducks' principal in The Mighty Ducks (1992) is now one of the Ducks' teachers at Eden Hall Academy===In Return of the Killer Tomatoes! (1988), John Astin (as Professor Gangreen) comes out in the same suit he wore when he played Gomez Addams on the TV show The Addams Family.===In \"The Big Short\" (2015) one of Mark Baums employees mentions in passing that Vegas isn't that bad and a great Japanese Restaurant just opened there. Later when Baum meets with the CDO manager in Vegas they go to a Japanese Restaurant===In The Hunt for Red October (1990) the character's start out speaking Russian then switch to English upon a character saying the word \"Armageddon\". Armageddon is the same in both language===Miyazaki adds to all his films, including “Spirited Away” (2002), quiet little scenes of inaction, called ‘Ma’, where the character just glances into the horizon and reflects, as a way to have a breathing room amid constant action (citation inside)===In Toy Story (1995), Baby Face taps a message to Woody using morse code. Earlier in the film, we see a poster in Woody's owner's room with Morse code on it, providing continuity as to why Woody would understand Baby Face's tapping.===Though it may seem obvious, many people don’t realize that the title of the movie Contagion (2011) refers to not just the virus - but the panic that ensues (fear and panic being themes of the film)===In Chicken Little (2005), the China Shop is owned by a bull.",

      "aggregatedTitles": "===White-browed tit-warblers are incredibly small, incredibly colored birds that live in central and southern Asia. They are believed to practice cooperative breeding, in which not only parents care for their young but also a team of other birds. These birds are called helpers.===The jaws of a jaguar are stronger than any other species of cat. With these strong jaws, they will crunch down on bones and eat them. Their jaws are strong enough to crack a sea turtle's shell.In fact, in the zoo, bones are part of a jaguars' regular diet.===Mongoose lifespans can be long; one female dwarf mongoose in Serengeti National Park lived 13 years. In practice, however, few animals in the wild live out their natural life span, and only 25 of 846 dwarf mongooses in the same study attained their 7th birthday.===Sea otters sleep holding hands so they don’t drift apart===The great horned owl has one of the most iconic hoots; its calls are often used in pop culture media. Even though the female great horned owl is larger than the male, the male has a larger voice box and a deeper voice.===Melibe viridis is a species of deep-water walking sea slug which interestingly uses an expandable oral veil to scan for prey as it moves along the bottom. When the sensitive papillae detect a crustacean, its usual prey, the inner edges of the veil quickly encapsulates it like a fishing cast net.===Meerkats are a type of mongoose that live in burrows in Africa. Remarkably social, they live in groups that can number up to 30 individuals (called mobs) that cooperate in keeping watch over their young. Interestingly, when females reach sexual maturity, they are usually banished from the family.===Like other toucans, the emerald toucanet (Aulacorhynchus prasinus) is a colorful bird with a large bill which it uses for eating fruits. Native to Central America, it is common in humid forests, mainly at higher elevations. When moving around in groups, they play \"follow-the-leader\" for safety.===The purple grenadier (Uraeginthus ianthinogaster) is a common species of finch found in eastern Africa. The male has a cinnamon-brown head and neck with blue patches surrounding the eyes. The breast and underparts are violet-blue. The female is mostly cinnamon brown with silver-blue eye patches.===The signature \"eagle\" scream often heard in pop culture media actually belongs to the red-tailed hawk!===Owston's civets are a rare civet found in South East Asia with only, they are called as vulnerable on the IUCN they are hunted for civet coffee, fur trade and tradition medicine. There is less then 20 in captive world wide and I lucky get to volunteer at a zoo with them and here is one being special===Frogfishes have a stocky appearance and rarely swim, preferring to clamber over the sea bottom using their fins as feet. Typically, they take cover lying in wait for prey, and then they strike extremely rapidly in as little as 6 milliseconds. They are found in most tropical and subtropical oceans.===This carpet shark, native to the northern Australian coast, is a long, slender shark that tends to be creamy or brown with variously-sized dark spots. They forage for food in tidal pools and risk being stranded, but they can survive for an hour without oxygenation or simply walk back to the ocean.===The Black Ribbon Eel (Rhinomuraena quaesita) is black and yellow and resembles an undulating ribbon while swimming. It is found in lagoons and reefs in Indo-Pacific waters and is easily recognizable by its long body, high dorsal fin, expanded anterior nostrils, and wide-opened mouth when alarmed.===The jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi) or eyra is a furtive, mostly diurnal, wild feline native to southern North America and South America with relatively short legs, an elongated body, and a long bushy tail. The ears are short and rounded, and its coat is without spots and uniform in color.===The peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), also known historically as the duck hawk in North America. The Peregrine is renowned for its speed, reaching over 200 mph during its characteristic hunting stoop, making it the fastest bird in the world and the fastest member of the animal kingdom.===Tasmanian Devils have incredibly strong jaws. In proportion to their body weight, they have the strongest bite of any living animal. Thanks to their powerful jaws and large, sharp teeth, Tassie Devils eat nearly all of their prey, even the bones.===Sociable Weaver build the largest nest of any bird and they can house over a hundred pairs of birds. Large nesting colonies can be active across many generations, sometimes over a hundred years.===Spotted hyena cubs are born all black but gradually shed this 'lanugo', starting with the head and then spreading down the neck towards the back of their bodies. The rate at which the lanugo is shed can be an accurate way of aging cubs.===The Spanish dancer (Hexabranchus sanguineus) is one of the largest sea slugs in the world and it can grow to 90 cm in length. Like most nudibranchs, it is brightly colored and venomous. When disturbed on the ocean floor, the slug folds its edges and undulates its body using flamenco moves to escape.===The Lady Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae), or rainbow finch, is a colorful passerine bird native to Australia. Interestingly, female finches are able to control the sex ratio of their offspring and reduce the rate of female offspring mortality by choosing mates according to their head color.===The reef stonefish (Synanceia verrucosa) is not only a master predator but one of the most venomous fish in the world, even lethal to humans. Its appearance is that of a crusty rock affording the fish uncanny camouflage. Each of its 13 dorsal spines has two venom sacs containing 3 deadly toxins.===When a bearded dragon headbangs, he is showing dominance.===The Bagworm Moth Caterpillar Builds a Log Cabin===TheʻIʻiwi (Drepanis coccinea) is a species of Hawaiian honeycreeper. TheʻIʻiwi's scarlet feathers were once highly prized by Hawaiian nobility for use in decorating their traditional feather cloaks and feathered helmets.
