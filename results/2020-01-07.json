      "aggregatedTitles": "===Talko Tuesday===[Schefter] New York Giants are finalizing a deal to make Patriots’ wide receivers coach Joe Judge their next head coach, league sources tell ESPN. Deal was in the works as of last night, which is another reason Matt Rhule took the Panthers’ HC job.===[Hensley] Ravens coach John Harbaugh on having a balanced team (No. 2 offense and No. 4 defense): “We never want to be a lobster — don't they have one big claw and one little claw? Is that lobster? Or is it some other clawed fish? I dunno. It's a crab, okay. So that's it.”===[Thamel] Sources: Baylor coach Matt Rhule finalizing a deal to become next coach of the Carolina Panthers.===[Rapoport] The #Giants have requested permission to speak with former #Cowboys coach Jason Garrett, sources tell me and @MikeGarafolo. He’s still under contract in Dallas until Jan. 14, so permission is required.===[Allbright] Panthers gave Rhule everything he wanted, wouldn't let him leave. Giants source says they're \"stunned.\"===[Smetana] Last year everyone wanted to hire whoever Sean McVay had once shaken hands with, this year its Belichick assistants. Next year it’ll be anyone who has ever coached Lamar Jackson. Welcome back to the NFL Bobby Petrino===[Schefter] Panthers are giving former Baylor HC Matt Rhule a seven-year - seven year - deal worth $60 million that with incentives could be worth up to $70 million, per league sources.==='Monday Night Football' shakeup expected to be on its way, Tony Romo and others are wild cards.===[Tomasson] 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan on criticism that #Vikings QB Kirk Cousins gets: “I just laugh at it. I think Kirk’s won plenty of big games. I just watch how people look on tape and I go with how good they look, not what their record is on Monday night.’’===[Rapoport] One note on the #Giants: Matt Rhule called them before signing his 6-year deal with the #Panthers and gave them the opportunity to match and lure him to get on the plane. They declined and hired Joe Judge instead.===[Pelissero] The NFL is reviewing #Seahawks DE Jadeveon Clowney’s hit on #Eagles QB Carson Wentz for a possible fine, I’m told. No suspension and may not even result in a fine. Clowney wasn’t flagged on the play, which took Wentz out of Sunday’s playoff game with a concussion.===[Rapoport] \"One big draw was #Panthers owner David Tepper being willing to put money into the sports science program that Rhule wants. Resources won’t be a problem.\"===[@Jeffzrebiec on Twitter]: Vrabel was asked about how to stop Lamar Jackson. “Other than try and tie his shoelaces together?”===[Yates] Matt Rhule took over a 4-7 Temple team in 2013 and led them to 2 of their 3 10-win seasons within 4 years. He took over a Baylor team rocked by scandal in 2017 and had the Bears vying for a playoff spot within 3 seasons. The man can build and lead a football team.===[Pelissero] Belichick had been grooming him. Judge just turned 38 and gets his shot sooner than expected.===[Rap] John Harbaugh and Bill Belichick have both been frustrated at the lack of interest in hiring special teams coaches as head coaches. Meanwhile, the #Ravens are the top seed and the #Giants just hired Judge.===[Hensley] Earl Thomas on Derrick Henry’s big game against Patriots: “Guys didn’t see too interested in tackling him. Our mindset is a little different.”===[Stapleton] Giants didn’t get him in the building. A stunning gut punch for the organization. Where do they go from here? This is a blow, for sure.===[Rapoport] Update on #Cowboys OC Kellen Moore: New coach Mike McCarthy would like him to stay and remain OC, which may also help Moore learn a new system. But he also has an opportunity to go back home and become the University of Washington OC under Jimmy Lake. He is mulling it all over.===[Zrebiec] Mike Vrabel said that Marcus Mariota will be used to simulate Lamar Jackson this week.===Can we take some time to talk about John Hussey’s officiating crew in the Tennessee/New England Game===[Verderame] The Cowboys denying permission to the Giants over Jason Garrett would be the chef's kiss to this entire debacle for both teams.===[Kevin Cole]There's the impression out there that Mike McCarthy couldn't maximize Aaron Rodgers when Rodgers' coach during perhaps the greatest sixth-year stretch ever (2009-2014) was none other than McCarthy. He can't get all the blame for the decline and none of the credit for the peak===[Yates] If the basis for your skepticism of the Joe Judge hire is the underwhelming year for the Patriots WRs, the more pertinent focus should be on the Patriots' special teams. They have been consistently amongst the most productive, prepared and creative in the NFL under his watch.===[Rapoport] One word of caution in coaching search world: Two of the biggest misses in recent memory are when the #AZCardinals never got the chance to interview Mike McCoy and the #Colts were jilted by Josh McDaniels. Both were crushed. But Bruce Arians and Frank Reich ended up just fine.",

In both, the exact words “You gotta be kidding me” are used when they see the Spider Head===The idea for stormtroopers came about when George Lucas wanted to create “living skeletons” as seen given the white and black armor perking up a dark room. Same goes for their stylized “skull” helmets. (Source : Every Stormtrooper in Star Wars Explained by Wired)===Titanic - 1997 The couple shown in bed together having accepted their fate is Isador and Ida Straus. They were the co owners of Macy’s. Ida refused to leave his side when he refused a life boat spot b/c there were still women and children on board. They were last seen walking arm and arm together.===In ending scene of the movie Arrival (2016) Louise knocks on window to call for Ian, similar to aliens (heptapods) trying to communicate with Louise.===Elvish Mis-translation in The Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies (2014)===In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Secret of the Ooze (1991), there's scars on Raphael's shell, showing how much more aggressive he is compared to his brothers.===In Pride and Prejudice (2005), at the first ball at Meryton, all of the local young men have long hair pulled back into pony tails except Bingley and Darcy.

John sees it later that night when he undoes it from her wrist sending Hans Gruber plummeting from the Nakatomi Plaza.===In The Shining (1980), Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) wiggles his finger when his “alternate personality” Tony speaks through him. This concept was actually thought up by Danny, who did it in his first audition for the part at the age of 4===A very minor Empire Strikes Back(1980) detail I find hilarious is how among all the scratches and dents and other damage on Boba Fett's armor, there is a very noticeable chip on his, um, \"cup\" for lack of a better term. Which means someone has canonically shot Boba Fett in the crotch at some point.===In Joker (2019), Penny Fleck's handwriting in her letters to Thomas Wayne varies drastically, possibly indicating emotional distress or mental illness.===In Zombieland Two: Double Tap (2019) there is a Twinkie plush on the front of Tallahassee's car to represent his love for Twinkies which was the McGuffin for the first movie (Zombieland)",
