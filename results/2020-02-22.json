Happy Birthday, Underage Drinker #1===During Shazam (2019) during the mall scene, the entire crew was accidentally left in frame and it wasn't noticed until the last second so they were edited in post to make it look they were just part of the mall crowd.===In the Clone Wars(2003) I Just realized this Jedi‚Äôs name is Sha‚Äôa Gi which is just like Shaggy===In Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace (1999), this shot of the gas leaking into the room with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan in the opening scene is the only shot of the movie with no digital modifications.===In Goldfinger (1964), Harold Sakata, who plays Oddjob, was badly burned by fireworks during a stunt scene. He continued clinging on to a hat while the fireworks went off around him, and didn't let go until the director yelled \"cut!\".===In A Sean of the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon [2020], the bottom of a pizza box contains one of the alien characters from Arrival [2016]===In Knives Out (2019), Linda is seen reading letters from her father that have slight burn marks on them.

Naomi Scott, the actress who plays Jasmine also stars in the 2019 Charlie's Angels remake, toward the end of the film she is captured and forced to wear a red dress complete with golden adornments.===Easter Egg in Cars 2 (2011) for Ratatouille (2007) Gusteau‚Äôs===In this photo from Avengers: Endgame (2019), Peter Parker is holding his internship certificate upside down in typical, dorky web-head fashion===In Ferris Bueller‚Äôs Day Off (1986) you can see the helicopter used for filming shots of the city===Mission Impossible / 1996 / Tom Cruise making the computer disc 'disappear' was real sleight-of-hand that the actor practiced for the scene===Starship Troopers (1997): In their television ad, the Federal Network have censored a cow being slashed, but outright show mutilated human bodies in the following shot.===Alien (1979) was originally titled Star Beast, until one word during a late-night writing session grabbed screenwriter Dan O'Bannon's attention. The success of Star Wars led to the movie getting greenlit after being in development limbo.===In LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) Sauron laughs after Gandalf speaks the Black Speech in Rivendell===In Knives Out (2019) a jug is shown to be missing from the shelf in Ransom's house.
