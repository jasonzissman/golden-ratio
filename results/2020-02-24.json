It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===Notice: As of 2/10/2020, we are requiring sources (in comments) for trivial details.===In ''The 40 year old Virgin''(2005), Steve Carell's chest hair was actually ripped out in the scene. The actor had told director Judd Apatow just before shooting the scene: ''It has to be real. It won't be as funny if it's mocked up or it's special effect.'' The scene had to be done in one shot.===In Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981), the stunt involving a tanker rolling over was so dangerous that the stunt driver was not allowed to eat food for 12 hours before shooting. This was in case something went wrong and he needed to be rushed into surgery.===While filming The Blues Brothers (1980), John Belushi‚Äôs coke habit was so severe Universal Studios included it in the budget. Director John Landis later found ‚Äúa mountain of cocaine‚Äù in Belushi‚Äôs trailer. The expense was approved so they could all work at night. Shit was behind schedule‚Äîcause blow.===In Batman Returns (1992) the shadow of Selina Kyle's glasses (literally) foreshadows her transformation into Catwoman.===Interstellar (2014) did not use any green screens===In The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), when Gwen Stacy dies the clock stops at 1:21. In the comics, Gwen dies in The Amazing Spider-Man #121.===Casino Royale (2006). Bond tips the dealer $500,000.00===For Toy Story (1995), the screenwriters taped shoes to a wooden board to help the creative team figure out how the army soldiers would walk and run.===One of the last photos at the end of Hangover 2 (2011) refers to the execution photo of Nguy√™n VƒÉn L√©m===Toy Story 2 (1999) was nearly deleted when an animator accidentally put an erasing code in the wrong spot. Pixar co-founder Edwin Catmull: \"First Woody's hat disappeared. Then his boots. Then he disappeared entirely.\" Luckily supervising technical director Galyn Susman had a backup at home.===In Lilo &amp; Stitch (2002) before the characters even meet, they both bite Mertle and Gantu, respectively. The bites and the response from the characters work to show how Lilo and Stitch parallel each other, and that others view them as freaks/dangerous/unclean (leading to infection).===[PARASITE,2020] the past nanny who ringed the doorbell completely changed the whole tone of the movie. From dark comedy to a thriller, It's almost as if the doorbell splits Parasite into 2 different films of equal length.This doorbell occurred at the EXACT midpoint in both the movie and the script.===In Gangs of New York (2002) you can see the rubber prop cleaver that Daniel Day Lewis throws at Brendon Gleeson hit the ground and is visible throughout the shot. Skip to 2:02 in the video.===In X-Men 2 (2003), Before Nightcrawler teleports into the cell to rescue the children, in a previous shot you can see that he is already in the cell. (apologies for picture quality)===In \"Frozen\" (2013) the Ice Harvesters in the opening scene pulled cubes from the water that floated as they should, with about 10% above the surface and 90% below. Just as in Icebergs. ~Neil deGrasse Tyson===In John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (2019) Keanu repeats the iconic quote from The Matrix (1999). \"Guns. Lots of Guns.\"===In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Secret of the Ooze (1991) We see Michelangelo standing over a group of robber while they beat an unseen person. We later learn that this is the result of a tactic Michelangelo uses to escape gangups===Sound of Music (taking place in the late 1930‚Äôs) has a modern building in one of the opening scenes.===In Killer Bean Forever (2009), when one of the bean minions throws a grenade, the lever falls off - a detail that‚Äôs often overlooked in other action films.===The beloved Australian film The Castle (1997) changed their main characters last name to Kerrigan so that they could use trucks from the real life small business Kerrigans Towing Service as props===For Mad Max (1979), director George Miller worked as an ER doctor to help finance the film. Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) is named after physician Carl von Rokitansky, who created the Rokitansky procedure, a method for removing organs during autopsy. To save money, Miller paid much his crew in beer.===In Disney's \"Monsters University\", Mike Wazowski is assigned the room \"319\", alluding to the original movie \"Monsters Inc.\" where a human sock is found on George's back. The code for this (alerting everyone of the incident and calling to evacuate) is \"2319\".===In the opening of Coraline (2009), the spinning wheel is covered in spider webs, hinting at both the Beldam's true form and the fact that it's been years since she last kidnapped someone (Wyborn's great-aunt).===In ‚ÄúThe other guys 2010‚Äù detective Allen (Will Ferrell) referencing the first time he shot his gun doing a desk pop earlier in the movie===For \"The Pianist\" (2002), Adrien Brody lost 30 pounds to play Szpilman, eating just two boiled eggs for breakfast, a little chicken for lunch, and a small amount of fish or chicken with steamed vegetables for dinner over a six-week period. At his lightest he weighted just 130 pounds",
