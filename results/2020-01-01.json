Hence the awkwardness from both actors.===In Alien (1979) to enhance the scale of the space jockey, Ridley Scott filmed his children in small space suits.===In The Last Sharknado: It's About Time (2018) when the main character goes to the future he asks one of the future robot clones what Deadpool movie they are on. This is a call back to Deadpool 2 (2018) where Deadpool asks time traveler Cable what Sharknado they are on.===In The Phantom Menace (1999), George Lucas told Ray Park to keep his piercing because it fit the character. You can also see it clearly in the 3D animated series The Clone Wars.===In Avengers Endgame (2019), Thor and the other Asgardians call Rocket a rabbit because raccoons were not introduced into Europe until the 20th century, long after the time of the Vikings.===In Independence Day (1996) they filmed Will Smith dragging the alien across the salt flats of Utah. Will Smith improvised the \"And what the hell is that smell?\" Nobody warned him of the horrible smell that sometimes comes of the Great Salt Lake due to billions of dead brine shrimp each year.===In Joker (2019) Arthur’s fingers are colored from all the smoking he does.===In Moana (2016), Maui signs her oar with a glyph of his fishhook. This is because at this time, Polynesian cultures did not have an alphabet-based writing system and wouldn’t develop one until after contact with Europeans in the 19th century.===[Easter Egg] In Crawl (2019) the dad's license plate reads MATT 725, seen out the garage door during a hurricane. Matthew 7:25 in the Bible reads \"The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.\"===In Joker (2019) you can see Arthur, writing with his right hand before switching over to his left. Possibly the inner battle of Arthur VS Joker===In Frozen (2013) Olaf’s arms only bend at 90 degree angles during his dream-like “Summer” song and when Kristoff intentionally bends them. Otherwise they stay relatively straight throughout the film===In Jurassic World (2015), when the ACU soldier finds the Indominus tracker, two drops of blood drip down opposite ways on the soldier’s arm just like Ian Malcolm’s Chaos Theory example he used on Ellie in the original Jurassic Park.===In Babe (1995), most of the animals on the farm refer to Farmer Hoggett as “the Boss”. The cat however, refers to him as “the Boss’s husband”, as for her Mrs Hoggett is the boss of the house.===In Jurassic Park (1993), during the raptor kitchen scene a crew-member's hand can be seen stabilizing the raptor suit in the doorway.===In the Pixar film, Inside Out (2015), during Riley's nightmare at her first night at the new house, the song that plays during the queue line at Disney's Haunted Mansion attraction is heard in the background.===Men in Black 1997- K says I guess you weren't alive in 68. MIB3 says....... See his DOB on his passport===In Jurassic Park (1993) The Triceratops dung didn't smell at all. It was made of clay, mud, and straw. It was drizzled in honey and papayas so flies would swarm near it.===In Upstream Color (2013), the main character is reviewing footage showing a creature made up of a box and alien-esque limbs - this is in fact test animation for the the writer/director’s unproduced script A Topiary, which featured this creature and others like it.===In Midsommar (2019), after Dani wins the dance contest you can see her sisters face in the trees with the exhaust hose taped to her mouth.===In Scott Pilgrim vs The World (2010), the bionic drummer that punches the highlights out of Knives' hair can be seen in backstage with Envy and Vegan Superman===Super Mario Bros (1993) - all of the cars are electric, because in the other universe the dinosaurs never died out, so there are no fossil fuels===In Scott Pilgrim vs The World (2010), Scott lands a 64 hit combo on Matthew Patel, And I'll explain further in the comments===In South Park, Bigger, Longer, and Uncut (1999), Sadam breathes out an american flag while saying \"It's not my fault / that I'm so evil / it's society, society\"===In Bryan Signer's X-Men films, (2000, 2003, and 2006) the X in Fox's logo is illuminated for a slightly longer time than the other letters.===In Contact (1997), the map that Eleanor Arroway uses to chart her HAM radio contacts similarly resembles the star map on the Voyager Golden Record (1977). Carl Sagan was part of the committee that chose the items for the Golden Record... he also wrote Contact, the book (1985).",

The quills are hollow and used primarily for defense, but also serve to insulate their bodies during winter.===The Superb Bird of Paradise is a species of bird that lives in rainforests. The males have extremely black feathers which can absorb 99.95% of light. This is actually because the structure of the feathers is different, not the colouring.===Pseudocheirus occidentalis, the ringtail possum (shown here) only acts somewhat similarly to its distant relative, Didelphis virginiana, Virginia opossum (being native to eastern and southern North America). Rinngtail possum live in Australia and are closer related to kangaroos.===The African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) is not closely related to the African bush elephant; genetic studies suggest that its closer relatives were the extinct Eurasian straight-tusked elephants, called Paleoloxodon antiquus - which would invalidate both genera as we know them.===The avian magnetic compass of the robin uses vision-based magnetoreception, where its ability to sense the magnetic field of the earth for navigation is affected by light entering its eyes. This physical mechanism is not fully understood, but may involve quantum entanglement of electron spins.===All of the wingless ants you ever see are female. The male's life is but a blip- only used for mating, and he dies within minutes once the deed is done. All that prospers are empires of women in the ant universe.===Dingoes can range in color from golden, tan, and ginger, to black and cream. These colours are found among pure dingoes, but can vary more when interbreeding with dogs takes place.

The hippos are so distinct that the species are two different genera.===White tailed shrew mothers are known to form \"tail trains\" to lead their babies along more easily===Blue tongued skinks can get up to almost 600mm and can often be found in and around gardens. But they are more beneficial than harmful as they are not venomous and eat common garden pests such as snails. https://australianmuseum.net.au/learn/animals/reptiles/eastern-blue-tongue-lizard/===The Olm is a cave-dwelling salamander. It is estimated that they have a maximum lifespan of over 100 years and they can survive 10 years without food due to their low metabolism.===Selective breeding has influenced genes affecting temperament and improving starch metabolism, effectively making both their personalities and their diets more compatible with those of humans.===Manatee calves stay with their mothers for 1 to 2 years learning feeding and resting spots and travel routes.===Aside from looking really cool, the Mantis shrimp has a punch that (at peak impact force) is comparable to the bite of a tiger - while underwater!===Meet the Northern Hairy Nosed Wombat.

All in all, Radin explains, \"there are only about 115 left in the wild, all of which are found in Queensland, Australia.\"===Unlike most other waterfowl Bufflehead Ducks don't nest on the ground but high up a tree. They've evolved to have the size of a crow with a comparatively big head (hence buffalo head) to fit nicely in the nesting cavity of a Northern Flicker or Pileated Woodpecker.===The Saigas eat several species of plants, including some that are poisonous to other animals. Their mating season starts in November, when stags fight for the acceptance of females. The winner leads a herd of five to 50 females. They are found mainly in Russia, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan.===The axolotl salamander has the rare trait of retaining its larval features throughout its adult life. This condition, called neoteny, means it keeps its tadpole-like dorsal fin, which runs almost the length of its body, and its feathery external gills, which protrude from the back of its wide head.===Do you know about Indian Muntjac Deer?

A lone wolf howls to attract the attention of his pack, while communal howls may send territorial messages from one pack to another.===Young male zebra finches begin life by making random sounds before learning complex songs from their fathers.
