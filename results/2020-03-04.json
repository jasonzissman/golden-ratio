It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===Notice: As of 2/10/2020, we are requiring sources (in comments) for trivial details.===In the movie Semi-Pro (1998) when Rob Corddry's wife is cheating on him with Monix (Woody Harrelson) his \"Kentucky\" jersey just says \"cuck\"===Lord Farquaad (Shrek 2001) was based on the Lawrence Olivier portrayal of Richard the Third.===In Cars (2006), there is \"Braking News\" instead of Breaking News===In The Incredibles (2004) Young Syndrome/Buddy is so dedicated to being a superhero, he colors around his eyes to fill in his mask===At 400 pounds, standing 16 feet high, and with an arm span of 23 feet, the skeleton created for Kubo and the Two Strings (2016) is believed to be the largest, most complicated stop-motion puppet ever built.===Roughly 25 years after Robocop (1987), and internet rumor began to get funding to build a 12 foot tall memorial statue of Robocop in Detroit. Eventually a real kickstarter campaign was started after Peter Weller (Robocop Actor) voiced his support for it. It goes up this month!===n Spider-Man (2002) Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider that gave him his superpowers. 5 years later, in Spider-Man 3, the creators didn’t forget to add this important detail in the form of a scar in the same spot.===In La La Land (2016), Mia tells Sebastian that she hates jazz in the exact spot where Pink Floyd’s photo was taken for their album “Wish You Were Here.” (explanation in comments)===During a flashback in Frozen II (2019), Agnarr is reading a book with a mermaid on the cover, and mentions to Iduna that it's from a new Danish author. Danish author Hans Christian Andersen wrote The Little Mermaid. He also wrote The Snow Queen, the fairy tale that inspired Frozen.===In Hook (1991) when Peter finds his happy thought and turns back into Peter Pan he gets his pointy ears back.===The name of Pixar’s 2018 short, Bao, is a play on words. 包, pronounced “bao”, is the Mandarin Chinese word for “dumpling”; however, this pronunciation is shared by 宝, meaning “treasure” or “baby”, and 保, meaning “protect” or “defend”.===In the movie Chef (2014) Jon Favreau takes his child to see moves. You can hear sound effects from Iron man, also directed by John Favreau.===El Camino (2019). (Last post was removed because spoilers)===In Knives Out (2019), the song that Benoit Blanc sings is “Losing My Mind”, from the 1971 Stephen Sondheim musical “Follies”. Rian Johnson wanted to include a Sondheim reference, because the composer was an “avowed mystery nut” and would throw murder mystery parties for his friends.===In the Godfather (1972) everytime there are oranges on the screen, death is in the air.===In Inglourious Basterds (2009). Dieter Hellstrom was able to hear the strange accent of Archie Hicox because the song stopped playing on the gramophone when Archie Hicox started yelling at the soldier (until that time, music had been playing throughout the scene).===In Tommy Boy (1995), Rob Lowe appears un-credited despite having a large role in the film. He was under contractual obligation for The Stand and did the film as a favor to Chris Farley.===In Mad Max: The Road Warrior (1982), Lord Humungus was originally written to be Jim Goose, Max's former partner who had been horribly burned. The concept was scrapped, but evidence of this still remains: the scars behind Humungus's mask, and the fact that his gang wears old patrol leathers.===For The Aviator (2004) Martin Scorsese wanted to imitate the color techniques of films of his childhood. To do this Scorsese and his production team experimented with color palettes and saturation and ended up designing a color timeline to mimic the early American Technicolor dye-transfer process===In Good Will Hunting (1997), Matt Damon wears a vintage \"Cobra\" race jacket. Cobra was a brand of car that was commissioned by Carroll Shelby, who Matt Damn portrayed in Ford vs. Ferrari (2019).===Ignore the 'Bierkeller' signs. When Loki orders the citizens of 'Stuttgart' to kneel in The Avengers (2012), that's the Tower City Complex on Public Square in Cleveland, Ohio (which once housed Higbee's, the department store where Ralphie first sees the Red Ryder BB Gun in 1983's A Christmas Story).===In \"True Fiction (2019)\" at about 36.12 min in, you can see a camera on a stick that surely went unnoticed in final production!===Elysium (2013) future world vs current world. Large portions of West Africa under rising sea levels and no forested areas left.===In Creed II (2018), at the beginning of round 3 in Creed’s first fight against Viktor Drago, the announcer comments that “...Creed has been beaten up and bloodied by an avalanche of power shots from Ivan Drago.” Ivan is Viktor’s father and trainer.===In Man of Steel (2013), the neck snapping scene marks the re-birth of Kal-El as Superman. Even the editing and the score is similar to the initial birth scene. Props to Snyder.",

They have primarily subsisted on bat guano which falls into the pools from above. The fish weigh about 2 lbs and measure 13 in on average, making them 10x the size of previously known cave fish.===The blue-capped ifrit (Ifrita kowaldi), native to New Guinea, is among a small group of bird species that are poisonous. They excrete batrachotoxin into their feathers and skin in order to defend themselves against predators. The poison is derived from the bird's diet of certain types of beetles.===Rats are very intelligent and can experience a range of emotions. Scientists have found that, when offered a variety of food choices but only allowed to choose one, rats can feel regret upon making the “wrong” choice.===A tigers skin and fur are both striped===nother fun fact about alpaca (and llamas) is they have no upper teeth- they have what we call a grazing pad where they grind they’re food against the pad with their bottom teeth and digest it!- source is me a trainer and multiple fair first place winner for 5+ years?===White-browed tit-warblers are incredibly small, incredibly colored birds that live in central and southern Asia. They are believed to practice cooperative breeding, in which not only parents care for their young but also a team of other birds. These birds are called helpers.===The pearly razorfish (Xyrichtys novacula) has the remarkable ability to escape predators by diving headfirst into the sand in a split-second breath-taking maneuver. It can also use its razor-sharp teeth to cut fishing line and netting by rotating its jaw to more than 90° to clip any entanglement.===A Giraffe’s tongue is so long it can lick its own ears===The hairy snail (Trochulus hispidus) is a terrestrial, air-breathing gastropod indigenous to Europe. These hermaphroditic snails use harpoon-shaped \"love darts\" before mating for the purpose of sexual selection. Hairy snails are known to crawl into the plumage of some bird species to over-winter.===Mongoose lifespans can be long; one female dwarf mongoose in Serengeti National Park lived 13 years. In practice, however, few animals in the wild live out their natural life span, and only 25 of 846 dwarf mongooses in the same study attained their 7th birthday.===The jaws of a jaguar are stronger than any other species of cat. With these strong jaws, they will crunch down on bones and eat them. Their jaws are strong enough to crack a sea turtle's shell.In fact, in the zoo, bones are part of a jaguars' regular diet.===Melibe viridis is a species of deep-water walking sea slug which interestingly uses an expandable oral veil to scan for prey as it moves along the bottom. When the sensitive papillae detect a crustacean, its usual prey, the inner edges of the veil quickly encapsulates it like a fishing cast net.===Meerkats are a type of mongoose that live in burrows in Africa. Remarkably social, they live in groups that can number up to 30 individuals (called mobs) that cooperate in keeping watch over their young. Interestingly, when females reach sexual maturity, they are usually banished from the family.===The great horned owl has one of the most iconic hoots; its calls are often used in pop culture media. Even though the female great horned owl is larger than the male, the male has a larger voice box and a deeper voice.===Like other toucans, the emerald toucanet (Aulacorhynchus prasinus) is a colorful bird with a large bill which it uses for eating fruits. Native to Central America, it is common in humid forests, mainly at higher elevations. When moving around in groups, they play \"follow-the-leader\" for safety.===Owston's civets are a rare civet found in South East Asia with only, they are called as vulnerable on the IUCN they are hunted for civet coffee, fur trade and tradition medicine. There is less then 20 in captive world wide and I lucky get to volunteer at a zoo with them and here is one being special===The purple grenadier (Uraeginthus ianthinogaster) is a common species of finch found in eastern Africa. The male has a cinnamon-brown head and neck with blue patches surrounding the eyes. The breast and underparts are violet-blue. The female is mostly cinnamon brown with silver-blue eye patches.===The signature \"eagle\" scream often heard in pop culture media actually belongs to the red-tailed hawk!===Frogfishes have a stocky appearance and rarely swim, preferring to clamber over the sea bottom using their fins as feet. Typically, they take cover lying in wait for prey, and then they strike extremely rapidly in as little as 6 milliseconds. They are found in most tropical and subtropical oceans.===This carpet shark, native to the northern Australian coast, is a long, slender shark that tends to be creamy or brown with variously-sized dark spots. They forage for food in tidal pools and risk being stranded, but they can survive for an hour without oxygenation or simply walk back to the ocean.===The Black Ribbon Eel (Rhinomuraena quaesita) is black and yellow and resembles an undulating ribbon while swimming. It is found in lagoons and reefs in Indo-Pacific waters and is easily recognizable by its long body, high dorsal fin, expanded anterior nostrils, and wide-opened mouth when alarmed.===The jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi) or eyra is a furtive, mostly diurnal, wild feline native to southern North America and South America with relatively short legs, an elongated body, and a long bushy tail. The ears are short and rounded, and its coat is without spots and uniform in color.===The peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), also known historically as the duck hawk in North America. The Peregrine is renowned for its speed, reaching over 200 mph during its characteristic hunting stoop, making it the fastest bird in the world and the fastest member of the animal kingdom.===Tasmanian Devils have incredibly strong jaws. In proportion to their body weight, they have the strongest bite of any living animal. Thanks to their powerful jaws and large, sharp teeth, Tassie Devils eat nearly all of their prey, even the bones.",
