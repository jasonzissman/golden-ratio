It blocks our path.===LPT: Never be mad at someone for something they don't know about. More times than not it's a miscommunication/misunderstanding and you can lose major relationships over it.===LPT : If you want people to return your pen after using it, keep the pen cap with you. This way ,when they try to cap it after use, they will realize that they borrowed it and will return it back.===LPT: if you’re learning a new language, watch your favorite movies (the ones where you memorized the dialogue like Pulp Fiction) in that foreign language on your streaming service. Try it without English subtitles.===LPT When upgrading your phone, if it’s in good working condition, DO NOT TRADE IT IN!===LPT: Think slower, not faster, to be a better problem solver. If you see a problem, plan out how to solve it, do that plan, and check to see how/why it worked or didn't work, you'll become a much more systematic and effective solver===LPT: If you find yourself wasting a lot of time on apps like Facebook and Instagram; delete the app and access the web version on your phone. You’ll see the same updates you’re normally looking for, however, the limited functionality is less addicting and the previous endless content is limited.===LPT: When entering a packed parking garage, instead of hunting for the first open spot like everyone else; Head straight for the farthest empty floor. Park right next to the elevators. it will end up taking much less time to park and you will be able to return to your car much faster.===LPT: If you are calling 911 (or equivalent) the first things you should say are the address and what service you need (police, fire, ems)===LPT: One of the best gifts you can give an expecting parent is a small screwdriver set, rechargeable batteries (AA &amp; AAA specifically), and a battery recharging device.===LPT: if you feel like being the edgy non sports person at your watch party today, please don't. People are allowed to enjoy things you don't and being intentionally obtuse isn't a personality trait that will have people wanting to invite you to other stuff.===LPT: If someone is telling you a story of how bad they’re hurting - emotionally or physically - don’t say “I understand” unless you’ve been through it. Instead, try saying “I hear you” and just listen to them.===LPT: Dont treat handicapped individuals like children===LPT: If you want to make watching the Super Bowl more fun, but don’t know much about football, you can place a small bet on “the over” for the combined point total. That means you are rooting for both teams to score points, so you can hope for success on every play.===LPT: When writing something fairly important, try to use Microsoft Word's Readability Statistics===LPT: Find a pair of socks you really like and only buy the same pair so you ALWAYS get a matching pair of socks from the basket after washing them.===LPT : Don't let your anger get in the way of good things happening.===LPT: Use 3D/force touch to open a new tab===LPT If you’re facing a large task, break it down into small jobs. I.E. “Clean Room” versus “pick up laundry”, “make bed”, “vacuum carpet” etc small tasks are easier to comprehend and thus easier to accomplish. Checking little things off also will provide some dopamine to spur you forward.===LPT: If it takes a really long time for the water coming out of your shower head to heat up when you turn first it on, run the water through the lower big tub faucet.

It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===In Spy Kids (2001) the chair legs are made out of lava lamps.===[Incredibles 2, 2018] The room Evelyn used to freeze Elestigirl was designed/built to cool DevTechs computers, it wasn't just a random freeze-your-captives room===In Groundhog's Day (1993), time stands still. I just noticed this for the first time today after dozens, if not hundreds, of viewings. The clocks next to Phil in the diner, which all have second hands, are not running.===When Disney+ suggests Monster's Inc. (2001), the credits cover Mike Wazowski's face===Shia Labeouf’s cheek scar in Fury (2014) is real, which he inflicted upon himself for authenticity in playing his character.===In Shrek 2 (2004), the Gingerbread Man has icing \"stitches\" repairing his legs which were removed by Farquaad in the first movie===Captain Ameria: The Winter Soldier (2014) Nick Fury relates a story of his grandfather being an elevator operator. In real-life, Samuel L. Jackson's grandfather was an elevator operator.===In Coco (2017) the buildings goes from Mayan pyramids to Spanish Adobes and onward as they get higher.===In \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\" (1993), Mama says \"Get My Coat\" before leaving the house for the first time in years to get Arnie. The family covers her with a quilt because her coat did not fit anymore.===In Sicario (2015), Alejandro quickly pulls a Glock 17 on a cop despite having a Mk23 pistol strapped to his chest, something he uses later during the mansion sequence. The Mk23 is heavier and bulkier than a Glock, making for a poor quick-draw gun, something an experienced assassin would know.===Probably the FIRST TIME when SELFIE &amp; selfie-stick was IN MOVIE before the big selfie trend! (movie - I Killed Einstein, Gentlemen [1970 - CZECHOSLOVAKIA])===Disney's Up, 2009, during credit role Russell and Carl take a trip to the movie theater.===In Guardians of th Galaxy Vol. 2. (2017) the bomb looks like a face (two eyes and a smile). The button that Groot keeps wanting to press represents the same eye (left eye) that Rocket keeps blinking with.===In 'The Core' (2003), the ultimate hacker's software has a typo.===At the start of On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969), James Bond (George Lazenby) rescues a woman before she runs away and says “this never happened to the other fella” - a 4th-wall breaking reference to the fact he’s the new actor portraying Bond after Sean Connery, who always got the girl===In Rise of the Planet of the Apes, you can see a character watching a Charlton Heston movie, a nod to a lead actor in the original from the 1970s.===In Return of the King (2003) Gandalf sends 3, not 2 eagles into Mordor after the destruction of the ring - because he expected to pick up Gollum, too.===Signs (2002) - upon learning Houdini is sick, Graham doesnt call the Vet but the town Dr (explanation in comments)===In Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince (2009), when Slughorn comments on Harry's eyes, he says \"except the eyes\" instead of \"except your eyes\". It may hint that Slughorn sees Harry as a collectible first, and a person second, as though he were talking about an action figure.===In The Man from the Diners’ Club (1963) the name of the German Shepherd, for whom Ernest Klenk (Danny Kaye) approved a Diners' Club card, is Maurice Baskerville, a reference to the famous Sherlock Holmes novel \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\", written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.===In Suicide Squad (2016) at the end when Joker rescues Harley Quinn from prison, his police uniform says ‘Joker’ on it===In Red Dawn (1984) the lone \"T-72\" was fabricated from the chassis of an US M-8 cargo hauler and fitted with a fiberglass turret and gun. Then repainted several times to appear in different scenes.===In Motherless Brooklyn (2019), you can clearly set set crew in the background of what was supposed to be an empty club.===In Back to the Future (1985), Doc's fire extinguisher is nearly empty, foreshadowing Emmett's lax fire safety protocols that will eventually cost him his mansion.===[Home on the range, 2004] There is a character named Mr. Wesley who’s name gets mispronounced to Weasley. This is similar to Disney’s Frozen with the Duke of Weselton and Disney’s Zootopia with Duke Weaselton both getting their names mispronounced",
