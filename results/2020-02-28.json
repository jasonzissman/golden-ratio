Now, it's a science-fiction novel.===[WP] As a teen, you daydreamed and wrote about a fictional world you created. Ten years later, you‚Äôve now started hearing voices. They‚Äôre prayers from the inhabitants of your world. To them, it has been 1,000 years since their god abandoned them and you must make things right.===[WP] You are an archaeologist. One day you find a cryogenics research facility that you determine was in use during the 21st century. In the cryo room you find one person still frozen. When you let them out, they have a smug look as they say, \"Has it been ten years already?\"===[WP] We were so concerned with the robots waging war on us that we hadn‚Äôt even considered them waging war on themselves. It‚Äôs 2050, and humanity is caught in the middle of a robot civil war.===[WP] humans were the diplomats and negotiators of peace . They kept their 4 world wars well hidden from the galaxy. When a warmongering species thought humans as an easy target, they found out how good at war humans really can be the hard way.===[WP] You‚Äôre a cafe owner who is also secretly a mage. One day a customer barges in, claiming to be a supertaster and demanding to know the secret ingredient in your poppy seed muffin. The secret ingredient was literally magic.===[WP] Genetics is everything. There are scales for wisdom, might, HP and mana, that are used on babies right after birth. You were born into an elitist family that discarded you after seeing your mana. What they didn't know is that you were the top 99.99% in dexterity, and you hold grudges.===[WP] As an immortal you make sure to move around every decade or so, to prevent any suspicion about your lack of aging. Recently you‚Äôve noticed a large number of old familiar faces. Maybe you aren‚Äôt as unquie as you thought...===[WP] After a drunken dispute, you challenged a stranger to a knife fight at the pier. When the two of you met up, neither of you brought a knife.===[MP] Astronomers detect biggest explosion since Big Bang 390 million light years away. Unknown to humanity this explosion was the conclusion to a universe wide war between good and evil, and the victor of that war is about to arrive in our solar system===[WP] You are a child therapist who treats extreme cases of children terrified of a monster in their closet. They're extreme because they're real, and you're actually secretly a demon hunter using these therapy sessions to gather intel on the monsters before killing them.===[EU] It turns out the wizarding world frequently uses modern technology, it‚Äôs just that Hogwarts and the UK wizard community is really behind on the times.===[WP] The archmage looked at your family's spellbook with awesome terror. \"I've never seen magic like this written down before.\"===[WP] Humans were just contacted by two rival groups of aliens offering space travel technology in exchange for being soldiers to fight against the other one. They may have technological superiority over us but as you just discovered we can do something they find inconceivable we can lie.===[WP] You are an atheist. Two gods bet on which religion you'll end up associating with. Years pass, the stakes raised, and their methods to ensure their wins are becoming more and more aggressive.===[CW] make a poem that when read forward it is from the perspective of a murder victim. But when read backward, it is from the perspective of the murderer.===[WP] You've always loved programming from a young age you were considered a coding genius. This morning while drinking your coffee you find a strange laptop and after poking around on it to find who owns it. You find a programming environment that allows you to edit reality.===[WP] In a world where a good portion of the population suddenly developed generic superpowers, a chef gathers and trains a team of generic super-powered cooks to create a brand new style of cuisine that would've been impossible to create in the confines of a conventional kitchen.===[WP] A dragon enrolled at a wizarding school. At first its reception was hostile, but when it demonstrated great capacity for magic, they began to make interesting adjustments to accommodate its differences===[WP] You never knew what the bard meant when he said he ‚Äúmaxed-out his charisma‚Äù until he not only managed to convince the young dragon to not seek fiery vengeance for her father‚Äôs death, but got her to join the party as well.===[WP] You're an evil overlord near accomplishing your goal. One day, meanwhile looking trough your telescope you notice a half naked person, doing strange stuff. Suddenly a chilling realisation comes to your mind- they're speedrunning...===[WP] You're a police detective. Archmages like you keep themselves hidden from the public. One day, when you're investigating the kidnapping of what should be a mundane child, you can see the missing child enchanted one of their toys. They had a plastic pokeball that contains and manifests a spirit.===[WP] When you scream you go back in time. The amount of time you go back in depends on your scream length; if you manage to scream for 10 seconds, you go back 10 seconds in time. Nobody can hear your scream, because you're travelling back in time as you do it.===[WP] You don't know why, but your body stopped aging at 24. You've been doing what you can to stay active in society while avoiding anyone noticing your youth. As technology has advanced remaining undetected has become harder.===[WP] I like to collect old items that were used heavily and forgotten about. Last night I caught the sword I recently bought talking to a broken lute I found hiking around ruins years ago. I think they knew each other.===[WP] Your seizures are getting worse and worse and you just had your worst one yet. You pass out and when you come to you‚Äôre in a field of blue grass with two suns in the sky. A sign in the distance says ‚ÄúWelcome to Centripita, Andromeda Galaxy‚Äù",
