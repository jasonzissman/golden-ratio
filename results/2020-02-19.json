For all you know, a 14 year old kid with very little life experience might be giving you advice on how to live your life.===LPT: If you want to view Quora etc posts without signing in then put ?share=1 at the end of the URL===LPT : Take senior family members along when you run errands just to get them out of the house.===LPT: When hiring a contractor include a one year structural warranty in your contract.===LPT: Parents, if your kid’s in college, stop being a bridge between them and the institution.===LPT: Aluminum foil tears in the corners when you try to line a deep pan? Flip the pan over, press the aluminum foil over the back of the pan (pan becomes a mold) and you have aluminum foil in the shape of the pan that will line the pan without tearing.===LPT: If you password encrypt a file containing sensitive data (for example your cryptocurrency private keys), encrypt a second empty file with the same password. That way if you forget the password, you can potentially pay someone to crack it for you, without giving up the data.===LPT: When hanging out with relatives, put some extra effort into talking to the less popular cousins. It's not easy being \"the other sibling\" who isn't as achieving. Often, you'll be their hero===LPT: Alot of people who want to get in shape follow up their training with light meals like a sallad because ”they dont want to ruin the training” and eat heavier meals on rest days. You will have better results if you do it the other way around.===LPT: If you are home alone and someone unexpectedly knocks on the door, yell “I’ve got it!” As you are about to open it, to deter those who may take advantage of someone home alone===LPT: If you’re learning a new language, start listening to an online radio station that speaks in that language.===LPT: Unclench your jaw, loosen your shoulders, relax your eyes===LPT: You can skip any YouTube ad (even unskippable ones) by clicking the (i) symbol in the bottom left corner and selecting “stop seeing this ad”===LPT for Interns faced with the \"What is your biggest weakness\" question===LPT: Turn you lights on when it's raining. You may not need them, but it makes you more visible to other drivers.===LPT: If you think you are going to puke, take an antacid, so just in case you do, your stomach acid will be less acidic and therefore less painful on its way out.===LPT When lending out money to anyone don't expect to get it back, but treat it as in an investment to learn more about the persons charecter.===LPT If the 4G is too busy, just switch to 3G!",

In the original short story the play is based off, the monologue Keaton gives about the elderly couple is actually spoken by Norton's character.===In Escape from New York 1981, the scenes tracking Plissken (snake) gliding over New York was made to look like computer graphics but was really made with wire frame models &amp; UV-florescent tape along the edges of the buildings to simulate computer graphics.===Where Dr.Facilier's shadow touches the wallpaper, it turns to crossbones (The Princess and the Frog [2009])===In Panic Room (2002), Jodie Foster calls her ex-husband for help and speaks to his new girlfriend over the phone - the voice belongs to Nicole Kidman who was originally cast in Foster’s role but dropped out due to an injury===In Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), the iconic twirling of the shotgun was achieved using a heavily modified prop gun.

      "aggregatedTitles": "===The maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) is the largest canid of South America. It is neither a fox nor a wolf. It is the only species in the genus Chrysocyon which literally means \"golden dog\", and it communicates mainly by scent markings and a kind of \"roar-barking.\" The maned wolf is omnivorous.===Twice a year 10,000 golden rays migrate to warmer waters (photos by Sandra Critelli)===The jaguar is the largest feline in the Americas.Black jaguars exist due to excess melanin from a genetic mutation. This mutation causes the skin and fur to contain larger amounts of a dark pigment.These types of jaguars are found in rain forest because its easier for them to blend into the shadows.===Maine Coon trivia: An average cat has 1 - 8 kittens per litter, 2 - 3 times per year. A Maine Coon in average has only 4, in rare cases more then 6 kittens per litter. By the way he is Odin, 6 years old and still a virgin.===Warthogs manage their ticks by having a mutualistic relationship with mongooses===The Bramble Cay Melomys is the perhaps the first mammal to go extinct because of climate change in the modern era. Some time between 2009 and 2014 the last of this species died, probably drowning in a storm surge on an island off the coast of Australia where it had thrived for thousands of years.===Alpine stick insects can survive the formation of ice within their tissues during the winter. This can be done through the production of ice-nucleating agents in their extracellular body fluid.===The lilac-breasted roller (Coracias caudatus) is a very colorful bird widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa, and sightings have also been reported on the southern Arabian Peninsula. Most often seen in pairs, they prefer open woodland and savanna where they feed on insects and small vertebrates.===The quokka (Setonix brachyurus) is a mainly nocturnal and herbivorous marsupial endemic to SW Australia. They are known for being highly promiscuous and for dropping their joeys on the ground when threatened so they can escape danger. Quokkas then make various noises to distract their predators.===The golden wheel spider (Carparachne aureoflava) is a huntsman spider native to the Namib Desert of Southern Africa. The spider escapes parasitic pompilid wasps by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes at speeds of up to 44 turns per second. On steep slopes it can travel 1m/sec.===Bald Eagles return to their nests year after year. Both the males and females participate in nestorations, weaving large sticks into the nests' exterior. For the interior, softer, comfortable materials are selected like grass or spanish moss. These massive structures can be 5 to 6 feet in diameter.===The so-called Sunda flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus) or Sunda colugo, found throughout southeast Asia, is actually not a lemur and does not fly, but instead, it glides as it leaps between trees. The colugo can glide over 100 m with minimal loss in elevation. Colugos are generally nocturnal.===Pygmy seahorses are tiny fish that are nearly indistinguishable from their habitats due to their size and extreme camouflage. They are so well camouflaged that Bargibant’s pygmy seahorse was only discovered after a host gorgonian was collected and observed by marine biologist George Bargibant.===The rhea males are the ones that tend to the nests and chicks. When the chicks get close to hatching they start whistling. There is audio in the article where you can hear the whistling.===The Philippine sail-fin lizard's most distinctive feature in adult males is the erect sail-like crest of skin at the base of their tail, up to 8 cm high, which provides propulsion for this strong swimmer to move through the water, and it probably also plays an important role in thermoregulation.===Screech Owls rely primarily on their hearing to hunt and evade predators. This guy was able to pass his live-prey test, and was successfully released after a stay at the rehab center===Harris's Hawks are sometimes called \"Wolves of the Sky\" because they hunt in packs like wolves. Their unique social nature also means that they may nest in group units or help injured \"packmates.\"===A baby hedgehog is called a hoglet and a group is called a prickle or an array. Unlike porcupine quills, their spikes are not barbed. They are partially immune to viper venom and, on rare occasions, they might attack and eat them.===Spotted Hyena milk has the highest protein and fat content of any terrestrial carnivore.===Honduran white bats (Ectophylla alba) or Caribbean white tent-making bats, create their own daytime sleeping quarters by using their teeth to cut the ribs of large leaves causing them to fold down to form a tent. They appear as white puffballs when they gather in groups. The bats mostly eat figs.===The fire-tailed titi monkey (Callicebus miltoni) was discovered in 2011 by a Brazilian primatologist in a small sliver of lowland rainforest south of the Amazon River. Since they are unable to swim or cross mountainous terrain, the monkeys are essentially confined to very small geographical area.===The rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta) is a threatened species of lizard primarily found on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, shared by the Republic of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Its name derives from the bony-plated pseudo-horn on its head which resembles the horn of a rhinoceros.===Pink-necked green pigeons are incubated by both parents for 17 days. They leave the nest 10 days after hatching, but continue to be fed by their parents for a few days until independent.===The Pinocchio lizard (Anolis proboscis) was first discovered in 1953 in Ecuador (only a single male specimen) and it wasn't until 2004 that more lizards were found. It is critically endangered and inhabits a very small sliver of forest habitat in the Chocó where it resides high in the tree canopy.===The trunk is used to drink, smell, pick up food, touch and communicate - this baby elephant is discovering their trunk",
