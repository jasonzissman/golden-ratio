No one will be able to get help in the end. we stand behind the medical staff who many sacrificed in Sars===Lam reverses herself: will charge non-residents for healthcare services. This is the power of strike: Lam is shocked by the exploding numbers of hospital workers joining union in the last 24 hrs===earlier at 2306 and the queue for applying membership for the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance is still on since 4pm. Hong Kong previously has NO labour unions on such before.===Carrie Lam and gang finally wear their masks.===United suspends some China, Hong Kong flights as coronavirus spreads===remember to wash your hands with soap because there are asshole like this guy who cough toward the lift button on purpose.===The Hong Kong-Mainland China border crossings that Carrie Lam closed from 1/28 (marked Â∞Å) versus the far busier ones that will stay open. The entry points that will be closed account for only about 8% of arrivals from the mainland.===Pro-Beijing party DAB met Carrie Lam today to inform her that closing the border to mainland \"must be considered\" and for now, only traveller with doctor's certificate should be allowed in. Non-locals should also be charged with non-local fees if they're treated in HK.===üë©üèª‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüë®üèª‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüßëüèª‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èMedical Professionals Presser [translation in comment]===Sophia Chan, secretary for food and health, claims that the Hong Kong medical staffs have the support from the government as always, while they did not listen to the demands of closing the border===Hong Kong rn be like (source: telegram)===Why does Hong Kong medical sector go on strike?===I've built a web app to track Coronavirus infections/deaths in real time, I thought you might find it useful===The hk hygiene department head, chan Siu chi, said shut down the border is not workable and need to consider the feeling of the mainland Chinese! Then who care about feeling of hkgers??!!===Another illustration of how much of the border is actually going to be closed: red is to be closed, green is staying open.===A viral photo appears to show ID cards from nurses at Princess Margaret Hospital supporting strike action if the government refuses to close the border.
