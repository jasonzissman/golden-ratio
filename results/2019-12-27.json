It is because you, a lowly grunt at BlasTech Industries, have been sabotaging their blaster shipments for months.===[WP] They say that when you die you're trapped in an eternity of your own memories until you can accept them and move on. You spent most of your life reading, so it was no surprise to find yourself in a library when you died. The surprise was the strange books that you never read.===[WP] As humanity finally takes to the stars, they realize they are the only interstellar empire to not be a hivemind. When humanity tries to discuss this with its closest ally, the aliens are perplexed, since they thought the humans' belief in the whole \"Free Will\" thing was just a practical joke.===[WP] In a house of time travelers it is tradition for future versions of oneself to come relay advice on the travelers 21st birthday. Today you turn 21, but the future you isn't showing up.===[WP]After being unjustly imprisoned by the \"Heroes\" of the country and having to watch all of your comrades get executed, you say to yourself in a fit of rage, \"If this is what is means to be a hero, I would rather be a demon!\" Then you hear a voice that says, \"With that, the contract is complete.\"===[EU] As a Stormtrooper you have unerring accuracy, almost always taking your prey out with a single shot. You thought nothing of it, having put in many many hours at the shooting range honing this, but Darth Vader has taken an interest in this almost force-like ability..===[WP] Heaven and Hell are confirmed to exist. World-class assassins now have to not only kill their targets, but ensure that the target goes to hell as well.===[SP] Humans are finally able to receive communications from aliens. After translating the message, they realize it says, \"Please help us, you are the only ones left.\"===[WP] You're the Grim Reaper.

Today seemed normal but the text above the person in front of you says \"Death: Cancer, 9 seconds.\" Problem is that he is healthy.===[WP] You were born with the most boring super power: you can tell exactly where the money you're paid with came from. Today, as payment for helping out a friend, you're paid in blood money.===[WP] The hero was blessed with the power to bring people back to life, resurecting their companions to keep up the fight against the dark lord. Which is why it’s odd that they brought you, the dark lord that they fought against back to life.===[WP] The demon stares at you, wrapping his bathrobe around himself tighter before taking the toothbrush out of his mouth \"Botch the summoning, huh? Welcome to hell\"===[WP] You are a high school clairvoyant, who can see a completely accurate future by making skin contact with a person who wants to know their future.

One day, a child reaches up and manages to pull off your mask.===[WP] When zombies started appearing, people got scared. It turns out zombieism is more like a degenerative condition where people slowly waste away. You work at a zombie hospice.===[WP] The primary civilization of earth is in the mantle and outer core, where inhabitants swim around at great pressure and thousands of degrees. Venturing too far into the frozen crust or white hot center would be fatal, of course, and there is only speculation of what is beyond.===[WP] The year is 8637. You are exploring the unknown parts of the milky way. One day you come across a planet that seems to have been populated by humans once.
