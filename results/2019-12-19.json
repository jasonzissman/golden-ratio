This is because he's a skunk cleaner shrimp, which means he eats dead tissue and other organisms.===In Apollo 13 (1995), instead of using CGI or wires to get the effect of zero gravity, the filmmakers used a padded, windowless Boeing 707 which climbed up to 30,000 miles, giving them a 23 second time frame to shoot the scenes. The actors and crew did this about 40 times.===In Avengers: Infinity War (2018) If you pay close attention to this scene where Stark puts on his nano tech Iron Man suit, the glasses are in Stark's, as he pulls them from his face and as his arm lowers, the glasses disappear which means his glasses are also made from nano tech===At the beginning of Home Alone (1990) Kevin‚Äôs dad tells him to pick up his Micro Machines because ‚ÄúAunt Leslie almost broke her neck.‚Äù Kevin remembers this and includes it as a trap for the Wet Bandits.===In Joker (2019), when Joker meets Bruce at Wayne Manor, the first thing the young Caped Crusader does is slide down a pole. Holy callback, Batman!===In Spaceballs (1987) there‚Äôs more examples of merchandising in the diner scene, with Spaceballs place mats:===This scene in Joker (2019) is completely improvised.
