The bar owner will think they came to see you.===LPT: Do not engage trolls. Do not burn any bridges.===LPT: No Christmas plans this year? Ask that elderly neighbour if they'd like to join you. Many elderly people spend Christmas alone and it's a really difficult time of year===LPT: If you‚Äôre a manager or a supervisor, don‚Äôt show that you hate your job. It makes your team/ subordinates feel uncomfortable and not wanting to come to work.===LPT: It's holiday season. At gatherings, refrain from asking people about their plans to have or not have kids. Definitely do not offer your opinion on the matter. It's none of your business.===LPT: Don‚Äôt ever ask someone when they are getting married to their significant other or when they are going to start having kids.===LPT: Pets are one of life's greatest treasures. Please respect them until the end.===LPT: Don‚Äôt tell the cashiers that it sucks to be working on Christmas Eve===LPT: While lending someone a pen, don't give them the cap. When they are done writing, they will have to return it or keep a capless pen.===LPT: Use the phrase \"My understanding was...\" instead of \"I assumed...\"===LPT: Christmas day is not the right time to bring a new puppy home. Young puppies need structure, quiet time, and naps. Either give something like a collar saying that a new member of the family is coming soon, or write a Christmas card that says there will be a special surprise after Christmas.===LPT: If you want to remember people's names, when they tell you their name, repeat it to confirm that's their name, and a few seconds into the conversation, repeat the name in your head. It will make sure you actually listen when they tell you their name, and connect the name to their face===LPT: USPS shipping materials are free. Stickers, boxes, forms, labels envelopes, etc, all free and delivered to your door step.===LPT: Write the body paragraphs before the introduction===LPT: Thinking about having a New Years Resolution? If it‚Äôs something you REALLY want to do, start it NOW! It will feel good to have some work done by the time New Years gets here, and you‚Äôre probably more likely to stick to it.===LPT: buy a pair of thermals/long johns to help keep you warm and your heating bill low throughout winter.===LPT: If you have friends or family living in a long term care facility/nursing home bring them a calendar and clock for their room because giving someone a sense of time in an environment that is always the same is important.===LPT: Want to go to the gym after work but always lose motivation? Change into your gym clothes right when you get home, even if you don't plan to go right away. Want to stop yourself from late night snacking? Brush your teeth right after dinner.===LPT: For those with unique names that people make comments about. The best way I've found to break the awkardness is to say \"Thanks, I got it for my birthday.\"===LPT: Save scrolling social media for when your alone. Live in the moment with those around you.===LPT: instead of getting your kids playdoh get modeling clay, playdoh dries out if left out whilst modeling clay does not.===LPT: Don't post pictures and rave about your favorite hidden gems such as camping spots, fishing holes, and the likes if you don't want them to become known, crowded, and eventually ruined.===LPT: If you are using a plastic shaker for protein shakes or shakes in general and you don't want it to smell even after you wash it, wash it and don't close it till it's completly dry. This prevents it from smelling===LPT: the barcode on the outside of every envelope delivered by the USPS contains your full address. Make sure to obscure it if you're posting it to social media.",

One side attacks and then the other side surrenders. When aliens attack a human city they belive the humans are defeated. They are not prepared for what the humans call \"Retribution\"===[WP] A tree began growing in the middle of a major city. It's bark was impenetrable; no matter what the city did they couldn't chop it down. It grew to a giant size, towering above the buildings, roots wreaking havoc in the subways and sewers.

When the population was in the billions, magic had all but vanished. But now that the aliens have wiped out 99% of the population, they are finding the last of the resistance quite dangerous.===[WP] A man is given the opportunity to exchange an hour from the end of his life for $50 whenever he needs the money. Although reluctant at first, he finds it gets much easier to make that trade once he starts.===[WP] As it turns out, Humans are the physically strongest beings in the universe.

Fast breeding, plenty of rare ore, low gravity. They don't stand a chance.===[WP] Alien ruins are found on Mars and other planets and moons all over the solar system. You, as a scientist on the Mars expedition, managed to decrypt a database. The aliens were dinosaurs, the astroid that hit Earth was a planet buster kinetic slug from Mars, and Mars was hit by Earth bioweapons.===[WP] Answering an online ad, you are about to start working at a pet store.

Dwarfed by a dime, it measures only 7.7mm (0.30in) long.===A cat has the power to sometimes heal themselves by purring. A domestic cat‚Äôs purr has a frequency of between 25 and 150 Hertz, which happens to be the frequency at which muscles and bones best grow and repair themselves.===Mexican free-tailed bats have deep wrinkles on the upper lip and in having a Z-shaped upper third molar, which is used for grinding insects===The long-eared pika, a relative of rabbits found in the himalayas, lives at elevations of up to 20,000 feet (6,130 metres), making them one of the world's highest dwelling mammals.===The Binturong, known as the 'bearcat', is neither a bear, nor a cat, but actually is more closely related to fossas. They have a muscular tail as long as their body, which they use both to grapple onto trees and communicate with other Binturongs. Their pee smells like freshly buttered popcorn.===The Frillback pigeon is a selectively bred fancy pigeon bred for having curls on their wing shield feathers.===The Bearded Vulture (Gypaetus Barbatus) is Europe's largest bird of prey, lives in the high mountains, looks badass and feeds almost exclusively on bones. Not marrow, bones. (Source: Wikipedia)===The bee hummingbird is the smallest bird, weighing in at 0.056 ‚Äì 0.071 oz===The long beak of a toucan regulates heat distribution, acting as a thermal radiator of sorts.===The American Fantails is a breed of fancy pigeon selectively bred to have up to 40 tail feathers.===Matamatas are carnivorous bottom feeders with a unique predation method that involves \"vacuuming\" up small fish and invertebrates.

Both parents share the duty of incubating their egg(s) as well as care for their young until they fledge.===The Tuatara is not a lizard, but actually the sole survivor of an order of reptiles dating back 200 million years ago. They are some of the slowest developing reptiles living today. Henry, Pictured, was still reproductively active at 111 years of age.===Bearded dragons are one of the most popular reptile pets due to their calm nature, but a little known fact about them is that they are actually venomous. Thankfully, their primitive venom, although related to rattlesnake toxins, is too weak to effect humans, but may be used to subdue their prey.===The New Mexican Whiptail is a species of lizard that is entirely female. They reproduce asexually, and lay eggs that will always result in female babies, which are genetic clones of the mother. Curiously, they still engage in ‚Äòmating behaviour‚Äô and courtship rituals with one another.",
