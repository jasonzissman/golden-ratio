      "aggregatedTitles": "===Gibbons are one of the only non-human primates which practice monogamy. Both parents play a vital role in raising of their young.===The Louisiana Green Tree Frog, Hyla cinerea, has been shown to choose prey not by size, but by activity level. 90% of prey was actively pursued, while only 10% was prey that wandered within striking distance. They have also been called the \"bell frog\" because of their distinct croak. Pic by me.===The red-capped manakin (Ceratopipra mentalis) is found in the tropical moist lowland forests of Central America. The bird is probably best known for the male's highly unusual and dazzling courting ritual whereby he shuffles rapidly backwards across a branch, akin to a speedy moonwalk.===The Gaboon Viper. They have the longest teeth of any snake, reaching up to 2 inches and are extremely venomous! Their bite might not kill you, but their bites are one of the most painful. They’re the fattest snake of the viper family, and have the second most venom behind the King Cobra.===Humpback whales use a technique called bubble netting which involves encircling schools of prey and blowing a series of bubble rings or vortex rings through the water which surround the prey, effectively trapping them into a ball so that they’re easier to capture en masse. Dolphins also do this.===Young eaglets are not able to thermoregulate until they are over about two weeks of age. Because of this, parent bald eagles will continue to brood their young after hatching. They will curl their fearsome talons to prevent any injuries to their eaglets.===The Fat Tailed Dwarf Lemur is the only primate that really hibernates. It gets ready for dry season by gorging itself and storing fat in it's tail.===The Eurasian Wren is a very small bird that measures 8-12cm or 3-4″ long. It is also the only species of wren that is found in Eurasia and Africa===The six-plumed birds of paradise, native to New Guinea, perform an impressive courtship ritual which includes preparing the stage by carefully clearing the forest floor, decorating the floor with red berries and rubbing branches with snake skin, and this is followed by an elaborate umbrella dance.===All 3 species of zebra have stripes; they must be important, but their main purpose is unclear. They may cool the zebra w/ the contrast increasing airflow; zebras indeed have more stripes in hotter climates. The complexity has also shown to confuse biting flies - which carry disease - when landing.===Little Red flying foxes like to hang in clusters, like a bunch of grapes, whereas other species of flying foxes hang separate from each other. They’re known for damaging trees as they are hanging in dense pockets across the branches and breaking them!===This long necked wierdo is called a gerenuk aka a giraffe gazelle and they have heavy butts for balance. Only the males have horns. They eat the lower part of trees beneath the giraffes and over the other plant eating mammals. They often weigh around 39 kilos (85.9 pounds)===The Araripe manakin (Antilophia bokermanni) is a critically endangered bird first discovered in 1996. It is endemic to the Araripe uplands in northeastern Brazil. It is estimated there are fewer than 700 of these birds in existence. It is easily identified by its vermilion red helmet-like crown.===Megalodon, meaning \"big tooth\", is an extinct species of shark that lived approximately 23 to 3.6 million years ago, during the Early Miocene to the Pliocene. It was formerly thought to be a member of the family Lamnidae and a close relative of the great white shark.===The semiplumbeous hawk is found in Central America and Colombia, and it often follows the large swarms of army ants that travel through tropical forests in order to capture it usual prey, antbirds, but occasionally it will feed on other small birds and bats. Its population is estimated to be &lt;10K.===The archer fish's most notable attribute is its uncanny ability to fire a \"super-soaker\" jet of water to knock down its insect prey into the water where it is quickly eaten. They can spray up to 10 ft with astonishing precision while at the same time compensating for the water refraction angle.===The broad-striped Malagasy mongoose (Galidictis fasciata) is native to the eastern forests of Madagascar. Their main distinguishing factors are their dark horizontal stripes and long bushy tails. Their primary prey is small rodents and they are mostly active in the evening and at night.===Golden eagles that live in the western continental U.S. tend to remain in their ranges year-round which generally means they have to manage to survive sometimes long and harsh winters. They will often return to their frozen prey during such times to feed if fresh prey is not readily accessible.===Nursery Web Spiders build cozy web-homes for their offspring, like this one built around several large leaves. Female Nursery Webs, like lots of spiders and their cousins, also tend to kill the males around mating time - to get around this, the guys play dead!===A shark rides the wave in to grab a fish on the beach, and has to \"sand swim\" back to the surf. Sharks have amazing abilities to sense for food, even on beaches, and then return to water when stranded on land, and they also have a good sense of direction as well.===The sarcastic fringehead (Neoclinus blanchardi) is a very bellicose saltwater fish that can open its mouth widely and use it as an assault weapon when engaging in territorial battles. They joust by pushing their distended mouths against each other, as if they were kissing, to determine dominance.===The umbrellabird is a large, tropical species of bird found in the rainforests of Central and South America. Its most distinctive feature is the inflatable wattle on its neck which serves to amplify its loud, booming calls. The male flares its crest into the shape of an umbrella during courtship.===The southern ground hornbill is a large predatory bird from South Africa. These birds live in open woodland, savannah, and grasslands. They eat insects, amphibians, mammals, birds, and reptiles and are large enough to eat hares and chase eagles away from prey!===The bones of chameleons can glow through their skin for animals with UV-sensitive eyes===The bald eagle is a bird of prey found in North America. A sea eagle, it has two known subspecies and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle. Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico.",
