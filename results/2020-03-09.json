      "aggregatedTitles": "===Pangolins or scaly anteaters are mammals of the order Pholidota. These species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin species are also known.===Gaeotis flavolineata is a partially transparent arboreal semi-slug endemic only to Puerto Rico whose bright green shell has evolved to become too small for it to retract into fully. Its highly reduced internal shell is calcified and covered with a flap of its mantle. It feeds mostly on leaves.===The flying gurnard (Dactylopterus volitans) is a bottom-dwelling fish of tropical to warm temperate waters on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. These fish typically have very colorful and roundish wing-like pectoral fins. They also have large eyes and a covering of bony plates on their heads.===The tufts on top of many owls' heads are not ears but specialized feathers called \"plumicorns.\" Though the purpose of these feathers is not wholly understood, two prevalent theories suggest that they help with camouflage (by breaking up the owls' silhouette) and with expression/interaction.===The ocean sunfish or common mola (Mola mola) is one of the heaviest known bony fishes in the world. Adults typically weigh between 247 and 1,000 kg. The species is native to tropical and temperate waters around the world. It resembles a fish head with a tail, and its main body is flattened laterally===The orchid mantis (Hymenopus coronatus) is a beautiful white, pinkish-white, or brownish-white species of praying mantis with lobes on its legs that look like flower petals which the mantis uses to its advantage when capturing its prey. It can change color depending on environmental conditions.===The Madagascar poison frog (Mantella baroni) is a colorful amphibian endemic to tropical forests throughout most of Madagascar. The frog is typically found between 600 to 1200 m above sea level. Its insect diet creates high alkaloid concentrations in the frog‚Äôs skin, making it to toxic to predators.===Red-footed boobies (Sula sula) come in various color morphs ranging from brown to white, but are all characterized by their vibrant red feet. They are the smallest species of booby.===Florida Scrub-Jays are monogamous cooperative breeders that mate for life. In most birds, after the offspring leave the nest they disperse to breed on their own. In Florida Scrub-Jays, the young delay dispersal, remaining with their parents to help rear their younger siblings for the next few years.===An auk or alcid is a bird of the family Alcidae in the order Charadriiformes. Auks are superficially similar to penguins having black-and-white colours, upright posture and some of their habits. Auks are monomorphic (males and females are similar in appearance).===Taonius borealis is a species of deep sea glass squid found in the North Pacific Ocean. It is also called a cockatoo squid because of the angled position of its tentacles that resemble the tropical bird's crest. It has a mostly ammonia-filled body and it sometimes releases some for buoyancy.===Many frogs practice amplexus. Males hold onto a female's back to fertilize her eggs as she lays them, and will guard her from other males.===New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides) have the remarkable ability to fashion tools for use in capturing prey. They are able to cleverly capture grubs in nooks or crevices by poking a twig at the grub to agitate it into biting the twig, which the crow then withdraws with the grub still attached.===Gibbons are one of the only non-human primates which practice monogamy. Both parents play a vital role in raising of their young.===Velvet worms are segmented panarthropods with stubby feet that subdue their prey by squirting a sticky, quick-hardening slime from a pair of glands on their heads. Once their prey is ensnared, the velvet worm bites into it, injecting digestive saliva to help liquefy the insides for easier feeding.===The red-capped manakin (Ceratopipra mentalis) is found in the tropical moist lowland forests of Central America. The bird is probably best known for the male's highly unusual and dazzling courting ritual whereby he shuffles rapidly backwards across a branch, akin to a speedy moonwalk.===A sabre-toothed cat is any member of various living and extinct groups of predatory mammals that are characterized by long, curved sabre-shaped canine teeth which protruded from the mouth even when closed. The sabre-toothed cats became extinct almost 11000 years ago.===Mayflies' adult stage do not survive for long - rarely for more than 24 hours to just a few minutes in some species.===Humpback whales use a technique called bubble netting which involves encircling schools of prey and blowing a series of bubble rings or vortex rings through the water which surround the prey, effectively trapping them into a ball so that they‚Äôre easier to capture en masse. Dolphins also do this.===The Louisiana Green Tree Frog, Hyla cinerea, has been shown to choose prey not by size, but by activity level. 90% of prey was actively pursued, while only 10% was prey that wandered within striking distance. They have also been called the \"bell frog\" because of their distinct croak. Pic by me.===The Gaboon Viper. They have the longest teeth of any snake, reaching up to 2 inches and are extremely venomous! Their bite might not kill you, but their bites are one of the most painful. They‚Äôre the fattest snake of the viper family, and have the second most venom behind the King Cobra.===The Fat Tailed Dwarf Lemur is the only primate that really hibernates. It gets ready for dry season by gorging itself and storing fat in it's tail.===Young eaglets are not able to thermoregulate until they are over about two weeks of age. Because of this, parent bald eagles will continue to brood their young after hatching. They will curl their fearsome talons to prevent any injuries to their eaglets.===The six-plumed birds of paradise, native to New Guinea, perform an impressive courtship ritual which includes preparing the stage by carefully clearing the forest floor, decorating the floor with red berries and rubbing branches with snake skin, and this is followed by an elaborate umbrella dance.===All 3 species of zebra have stripes; they must be important, but their main purpose is unclear. They may cool the zebra w/ the contrast increasing airflow; zebras indeed have more stripes in hotter climates. The complexity has also shown to confuse biting flies - which carry disease - when landing.",
