($7 million when adjusted for inflation). This was equal to the entire budget of the first Bond movie, Dr No (1962). It needed 711 tons of steel. 50 plasterers and 60 riggers worked day and night to bring it to life.===The girl In the ‚ÄúMy neighbor Totoro‚Äù (1988) poster doesn‚Äôt exist in the film and is a mix of the two main characters. In early stages of production they had only pictured one girl for the role, but later spilt her into two. In the end the studio decided to keep the concept as the official art.===In Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), the opening scene was shot at a demolished steel plant. The twisted motorcycles, burnt cars and blackened cinders are debris from the Universal Studios fire of 1989, when a disgruntled security guard torched the back lot.===In Batman Begins (2005) when Bruce Wayne sprays his suit black, he was using a black-latex spray which removes the heat signature from appearing on thermal vision/goggles===The Sound of Music (1965) required a scene with Nazi troops and banners, but city officials said Salzburg were never Nazi sympathizers and would not allow the swastikas. After the director said he would use actual newsreels of Hitler arriving to cheering city crowds, permission was swiftly granted.===In IT 2017 Pennywise suddenly appears in a mural behind the losers club===The crocodile stunt in Live and Let Die (1973) in which Bond jumps across 3 crocodiles, was performed by a man named Ross Kananga. He owned a crocodile farm-with a ‚ÄúTrespassers will be eaten‚Äù sign on the fence. The films writer was so taken with Kananga that he named the villain after him.===At the end of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005) Marvin says \"the restaurant is at the OTHER end of the universe.\" The Restaurant at the End of the Universe was the 2nd novel by tHGttG creator Douglas Adams with a restaurant at the actual END (time not place) of the universe.===In PARASITE (2019), Mrs. Park lies about Ki-woo's tutoring wages: when nobody is watching, she skims off ‚Ç©100,000 from the old tutor's envelope (1:40) but then sweetly tells Ki-woo that she decided to pay Ki-woo *more* than his predecessor due to \"the cost of living\" and the current economy===Star Trek Generations (1994) was the first movie to have a website created specifically to promote it. The site was launched at generations.viacom.com on October 28, 1994.===There are few littles easter eggs in the end credit of Hot shots ! 2 (1993 ).

Could it be a foreshadowing or a fast-forward to Elio when he matures in the next (?) film?===In the liquor store flashback scene in The Hangover Part III (2013), Alan can be seen purchasing a bottle of Jager and a bag of skittles which is a reference to The Hangover (2009) when Alan yells at Chow for stomping on his satchel that had skittles in it.===In Olympus Has Fallen(2013) during the part with the rooftop snipers they shoot off to shots with out pulling the bolt back to reload. You can clearly see they are using bolt actions.===From David Lynch's Wild at Heart (1990). In Farragut's execution scene they show him Marietta's ring before dead. There are \"Allah\" and \"Allahu Akbar\" signs in Arabic on the ring.===In Step Brothers (2008), while putting his scrotum on Dale's drumset, Brennan exclaims, \"John Bonham's playing 'Moby Dick' for real!\" In addition to being a dick joke, the line is a reference to \"Moby Dick\" by Led Zeppelin, an instrumental song consisting largely of a drum solo by John Bonhan.===In RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981), they fired a chunk of telephone pole out of the bottom of the truck carrying Marion in an attempt to make it flip in the air before exploding ... the flip didn't work, and you can see the telephone pole sticking out of the bottom of the truck ...===For Robin Hood Prince of Thieves (1991) Alan Rickman was so unhappy with the 'terrible' script that he had friends help him rewrite his scenes to give him better lines. He won a Bafta for his performance===In the movie Frozen 2 (2019) my 6 year old daughter pointed out Big Hero 6 as a doll being played with!===In The Matrix Reloaded (2003), the iconic silver Cadillac CTS used in the freeway scene was not yet released to the public.===Once Upon A Time In Hollywood 2019: The railings at the Nazi building during the cutaway to one of Rick's movies are shaped like swastikas===In Men In Black (1997) Agent J's 3rd grade teacher is revealed to be an alien, teaching in Philadelphia.
