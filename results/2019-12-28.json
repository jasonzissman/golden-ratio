Instead of calling a national number, quick search for a nearby flower shop. You'll get more for your money that way.===LPT: You can disable the Reddit mobile watermark under “Saved image attribution” in settings.===LPT: The easiest way to smile is to laugh a little and hold the face. Took 20+ years of awkward photos until I found this trick.===LPT: After the New Year, always write the year in full (1/2/2020 or 3/4/2020 instead of 1/2/20 or 3/4/20) because if you write just 20, there is a chance someone might change that to 2008 or 2014 or whatever to void legal documents.===LPT: If you’re ever thinking about something embarrassing you did x amount of years ago, try to remember something embarrassing someone else did. It will most likely be really hard if you can do it at all.===LPT: make note of where your small pet hides when they’re scared and keep a carrier/backpack near that area.===LPT: Want that amazing firewood smell in your house? Don't have a fireplace? Burn some garlic peels===LPT: If you have brightly dyed hair, bring your own dark pillowcase when staying with friends/relatives so you don't stain theirs.===LPT: To stop iOS apps from begging to be reviewed on iOS 13 (and in the future, hopefully), go to Settings -&gt; Your Name/Profile -&gt; iTunes &amp; App Store, and scroll to the bottom. Now click “In-App Ratings and Reveiws”.===LPT: Consistency in the gym is much more valuable than efficiency===LPT: If you do a half assed job, the job will take twice as long. Do it right the first time.===LPT: If you someone seems like they could be in danger, even if you believe it's a joke, take it seriously. It's better to respond to a false alarm than to ignore a real one.===LPT: When you get a card in the mail from a friend/family member quickly add their return address to their contact information in your phone. Then the next time you want to send out cards, gifts, invitations etc you have their address already and you don’t have to ask for it again.===LPT: When using dating apps make sure to video call someone before meeting them in person===LPT: Google Docs can help remotely check if a PC is up and running===LPT: Order Walmart pickup===LPT chances are you will never need this, but as a safety precaution, when meeting someone in person who you met online, enable location sharing on your phone with a loved one and provide that persons basic information. This will exponentially increase your chances should the worst happen.===LPT Set up an email just for receipts. Email pics of receipts that are larger purchases to the email and tag it in the body things like “Home Depot”, “ceiling fan” “ lifetime warranty”===LPT: Anytime you have an MRI/CT done, request a copy of the cd or radiology report. Medical records can be crazy expensive and a headache to retrieve later on should you need to seek a second opinion===LPT: despite what the TV shows and movies demonstrate, always use a cane or crutch on the opposite side of your injured leg. This allows you to offload your injured leg instead of shifting more weight towards it, gives you a wider base of support to prevent falling, and allows a more natural gait===LPT: When tipping the housemaid in a hotel, give the tip directly to the housekeeper. Housekeeper managers sometimes steal the tip money from their employees.===LPT: When doing laundry, throw the measuring cap into the wash with the load!
