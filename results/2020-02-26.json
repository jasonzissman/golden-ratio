The stump is shown just once in the film. Every other time, his arm is cleverly concealed behind people, under a table or in a stiff jacket.===In The Usual Suspects (1995), due to Benicio Del Toro's unusual choice of accent, the rest of the cast were encouraged to adlib reactions.===In The Lion King (1994) the friendship between Timon and Pumbaa may not be as unlikely as you think. Real life warthogs have a mutualistic relationship with mongooses===In Insomnia (2002), Al Pacino‚Äôs protagonist is named Will Dormer - ‚Äúdormer‚Äù sounding similar to ‚Äúdormir‚Äù, the root of the term ‚Äúto sleep‚Äù - which is a theme of the movie - his insomnia and inability to sleep===In Die Hard (1988), during the scene where John McClane (Bruce Willis) falls down a ventilator shaft, his stuntman (Keii Johnston) was supposed to grab onto the first vent. He missed. The footage was so good that editor Frank J. Urioste left it in the movie.===In The Hobbit: The desolation of Smaug (2013), when Balin is worried that Thorin will get cursed by the gold ( happened to his grandfather), he exclaims: ‚ÄúI am not my grandfather!‚Äú.

This is similar with Comet Hale‚ÄìBopp, discovered by professional astronomer Alan Hale and amateur astronomer Thomas Bopp in 1995.===In The Mask of Zorro (1998), when the explosion happens, all the of the dons brace while Don Rafael, Captain Love and Alejandro do not. ‚ÄúAll that shooting guns, racing around on horses gives me a frightful headache. It‚Äôs hardly the work of a gentleman.‚Äù===In The Emperor's New Groove (2000), the salt and pepper shakers at the restaurant are shaped like llamas.===Kubrick fan Paul Thomas Anderson used a Carl Yastrzemski baseball bat in his film Inherent Vice (2014). It‚Äôs the same model used by Wendy Torrance in The Shining (1980).===In The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), the shadows and sunlight were literally painted on the set to distort the viewer's sense of perspective===In Joker (2019), the scene that cuts away after Joker goes to the camera, you can actually see the rest of the scene in one of the TVs===In Ouija (2014), the string lights that a character uses to hang themselves are placed back in their bedroom for a later scene in the movie.===In the film Matrix Reloaded (2003), the candy that the Oracle eats is another red pill.===In Thor: Ragnarok (2017), during the play depicting Loki‚Äôs ‚Äúdeath‚Äù on Sv√°rtalfheim, the music is the same as the music in Frigga‚Äôs funeral in Thor: The Dark World (2013).===Knives Out (2019) Steelbook detail!

Ya manatee love!===The Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) is native to the estuaries of the Bay of Bengal and Southeast Asia and is nearly extinct. The latest reports indicate that only 85 individuals remain in one of three existing populations despite tremendous efforts to save them from death by gill nets.===The Indian Bullfrog male, during the monsoon mating season, turns from drab green to yellow in color and their vocal sacks turn blue. Their loud bellows and changed appearance are key in attracting females. These frogs are able to jump right out of water as though on land despite their huge size.===The Thylacine, or Tasmanian Tiger, was the largest carnivorous marsupial until it's extinction in 1936. Can you believe these guys had pouches?===The spotted white porcelain anemone crab has highly unusual seafan-shaped claws which it uses to filter the water while sitting on top of an anemone by first collecting mucus from its host anemone's tentacles and then using that to attract and gather small sea creatures and plankton for food.===Stomphia coccinea is a small reddish or pinkish sea anemone that has the remarkable ability to detach itself and swim away from predators when necessary. In the gif, when the starfish's sensory organs touched the sea anemone, it rocked back and forth prying itself from its anchorage and escaped.===The bi-color parrotfish (Cetoscarus bicolor), found only in the Red Sea, is among the largest of parrotfishes growing to about 50 cm in length. Interestingly, it is a sequential hermaphrodite, starting first as a dark brown female and then changing to either a brightly colored male or female.===Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) are an endangered species of Old World vulture that has been observed using tools. They will throw rocks at large, thick-shelled eggs of other species to crack them open, and can walk hundreds of meters away from an egg to find a suitable rock.===The slingjaw wrasse (Epibulus insidiator) is native to tropical waters of the Indo-Pacfiic. The most notable feature of sling-jaw wrasses is that the mouths of these fish are armed with highly protrusible jaws which unfold into a tube about half its body length and increase its striking distance.===Ferret spines are designed differently, to make them extra wiggly===When the aardwolf smells termites or hears the rustle of thousands of them in the grass with its sensitive pointed ears, it laps them up with its sticky tongue.===A baby porcupine is called a porcupette and (for some strange reason) when they are born their quills are soft. Within minutes though, the keratin from which they are made, hardens-up and their quills become sharp like those of an adult. (Viral feeding time video in comments.)===The turquoise-browed motmot (Eumomota superciliosa) is a colorful bird found in open habitats along the edges of forests extending from the Yucat√°n Peninsula to Costa Rica. They often perch on fences and posts scanning the fields for insects. It is the national bird of El Salvador and Nicaragua.===The rainbow grasshopper (Dactylotum bicolor) is native to the United States, Canada and northern Mexico. When threatened, it exhibits aposematism or \"warning coloration\" to mimic brightly colored stinkbugs which lizards may avoid. Studies show that birds find rainbow grasshoppers to be distasteful.===These ethereal and ghost-like creatures are actually sea slugs‚Äîpart of a large group of marine invertebrates===Siberian salamanders can survive in temperatures as low as -45¬∞C! They use a antifreeze like chemical to help protect them.===The colorful oriental dwarf kingfisher (Ceyx erithaca) is endemic across much of the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia and is found along small streams in densely shaded forests. It feeds on a wide variety of creatures: fish, geckos, skinks, crabs, snails, frogs, crickets, and dragonflies.===Umbonia ataliba is a species of thornbug endemic primarily to mountainous areas of Costa Rica and it is usually found in more abundance ~ 1000m in elevation and above. This insect has lately drawn increased research interest because of climate change impacts on its fecundity and mating behavior.===The seven-colored tanager (Tangara fastuosa) is a vulnerable species of bird endemic to forests in north-eastern Brazil. Its colors are turquoise-green, black, bright blue, ultramarine blue, paler turquoise-blue, dark blue and orange. They are often seen in pairs feeding on berries, seeds and fruit.===The Debelius' Reef Lobster most commonly has a lavender body with violet bumpy round spots and violet claws tipped with orange stripes. They also may occur in different colors including purple, pink, orange and yellow. These lobsters are found on tropical reefs in Indo-Pacific waters.===The Imperial Tortoise Beetle (Stolas imperialis) is indigenous to Brazil and bears a striking resemblance to a turtle. They are among the most brilliantly colored among beetles, and native populations are known to use them as jewelry. They are generally less than half an inch in length.===One of the most distinctive features of the coconut octopus is its suckers. They are almost white and really stick out when the creature has assumed a darker color. The contrast in colors between its body and its suckers can create a fluorescent effect for the suckers.===The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is a large livestock guardian dog breed from the Caucasus Mountains, commonly bred in the mountainous regions of Transcaucasia, especially in Georgia.===Bald Eaglets are covered in light gray down after hatching; after roughly 3-6 weeks, their dark brown juvenile plumage will molt in. Eaglets grow rapidly and fledge from the nest in about 10-12 weeks.===The pompadour cotinga (Xipholena punicea) lives in the Amazonian rainforest and has a range that includes Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and the Guianas. These birds mainly eat fruits, and males are known to perform elaborate mating displays for the females who then raise the young alone.",
