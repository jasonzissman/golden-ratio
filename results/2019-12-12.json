This makes them feel more respected and be more inclined to do you favors in the future.===LPT: Always give people the benefit of the doubt if they tell you they are disabled or chronically ill. Lots of conditions are 'invisible' and invisibly ill folks get a lot of grief from not being believed. You'll be a better person for taking their word for it.===LPT: If a service dog without a person approaches you, it means that the person is in need of help.===LPT If a person you've met before confronts you about seeing them in public and not saying hi, tell them \"I didn't think you'd remember me\".===LPT: if your new year‚Äôs resolution is going to include improving your fitness, you should start researching and even practicing your workout routine now so you are more likely to continue your progress after the new year starts.===LPT: a simple ‚ÄòAre you sure?‚Äô when someone refuses something out of politeness goes a long way.===LPT: It is the time of the year when you may receive gift cards as presents. To thank the person, write their name on the gift card and when you spend it send them a quick text or picture thanking them!===LPT: partners of women who are pregnant or who have recently had a baby. Read up on postpartum depression. You may be able to spot the signs earlier than she does.===LPT: Drag YouTube URLs into VLC to watch only the video and with all the features of VLC===LPT: Look through your saved posts/comments, there is a reason you saved them.===LPT: If you have a password that you type in manually many times a day, try incorporating something nice into it and getting rid of anything negative. By mentally repeating it all the time you‚Äôre turning any word, phrase or concept in it into your constant subconscious background thought.===LPT: You can remove/hide the popup banner requesting you to turn off your AdBlocker or pay for a subscription to a news site by simply right-clicking on the banner, selecting 'inspect' and typing 'display:none;' on the right. No more popup or paywall blocking the page you want to read!===LPT: Go back and play games you haven't touched in a while. You probably have forgotten a lot about them and may find renewed enjoyment.===LPT: A lot of the 'best product' reviews make their money off commissions. If the review has a link to buy the product, and you follow the link and purchase it, the review site gets a kick back. These reviews cannot be trusted. They are biased. Buyer beware!===LPT: When you owe money and are broke, send something/anything rather than nothing.===LPT: Keep inviting that friend who always says no===LPT: Always add an additional finger print on your phone while your finger is sweaty.===LPT for those having issues with heavy 4k HDMI TV cables===LPT: When writing a big research thesis, start way before the deadline so when you find a paper to cite that's behind a paywall you can email the professor that wrote it instead and hopefully save a couple bucks.===LPT: If you have to pick a person up at the airport, ask them their flight number instead of the time it lands. The aircraft might be delayed (or even arrive early) and the person or you might be stuck at the airport for long waiting===LPT: If you really need to take a dump, but you're far away from a restroom, start retching and acting like you're throwing up. It tricks your body into decreasing peristalsis and reduces the urge to take a dump.===LPT: Seek knowledge, not results.===LPT: Use a potato peeler to cut cheese into thin even slices straight off the block.===LPT: This holiday season, don't \"gift up\" at work.",
