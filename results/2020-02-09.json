      "aggregatedTitles": "===The red-crested turaco (Tauraco erythrolophus), the national bird of Angola, is one of the more colorful birds in its genus, and its call sounds somewhat like a jungle monkey. Turacos are found in large flocks and feed on ripe fruits. Interestingly, all flock members help new moms with \"childcare.\"===This is the Ili pika, an endangered animal native to Northwestern China. It has only been seen a few times, and there are estimated to be less of 1000 of them left.===The muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), the only species in genus Ondatra, is a medium-sized semi-aquatic rodent native to North America and is found in wetlands over a wide range of climates and habitats. Muskrats mate while underwater and can also hold their breaths for up to 20 minutes underwater.===The point colouration typical of Siamese cats is a form of partial albinism and is caused by an enzyme involved with producing colour pigment that is heat sensitive and only functions in a cool environment. (More details in comments)===Clownfish like Nemo are in the family Anemonefish that includes about thirty other species. When the lone female in a group of Anemonefish dies, the biggest male (the only one that was breeding) becomes a female and resumes reproduction - now with the new largest male.===The cougar (Puma concolor) is native to the Americas and has the widest range of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere which accounts for all its other names: puma, mountain lion, red tiger and catamount. Its range extends from Canada to the southern regions of South America.===The thorn treehopper (Alchisme grossa) is one of the most attentive of all insect parents. She will fiercely defend her offspring until they are fully grown using her thorn-shaped headdress as a shield and intimidation tool. This insect is found in abundance in the rain cloud forests of Bolivia.===The Arabian sand boa's eyes are small and located on the top of its head. It hides below the surface of the sand with its eyes projecting out in order to ambush prey.===Parrotfish help create most of the the beautiful white sand beaches often found near coral reefs, like in Hawaii. They eat pieces of dead coral that are covered in algae, digest the algae, and then poop out the broken down coral which becomes the white sand===The Eurasian hoopoe (Upupa epops) is the most widespread species of the genus Upupa, native to Europe, Asia and the northern half of Africa. Interestingly, the hoopoe flies more like a butterfly than a bird with its rounded wings closing only halfway in flight. It is the national bird of Israel.===The Cuban tody (Todus multicolor) is a bird species in the family Todidae that is found in Cuba and adjacent islands. This species nests in holes burrowed in clay embankments, occasionally in a rotten tree trunk or even at the entrance to limestone caves. They are most often seen in pairs.===Spring Peepers are a relatively small frog that actually freeze solid each winter, just like Wood Frogs and a number of other amphibians. They make loads of sugar and pump it around their bodies where it works as an antifreeze - preventing ice crystals from forming and stabbing their cells===When Dung Beetles spot soft soil, they stop and bury the ball, then mate underground. After the mating, one or both of them prepares the brooding ball. When the ball is finished, the female lays eggs inside it, a form of mass provisioning.===This handsome arachnid is either a mature male pamphobeteus platyomma (Brazilian pink bloom tarantula) or mature male pamphobeteus machala (Purple bloom tarantula). This genus includes some of the largest tarantulas in the world, and they are capable of eating small birds, reptiles and mammals.===The Barn Owl (Tyto alba) has excellent low-light vision and extremely quiet flight, and can easily find prey at night by sight, however, its ability to locate prey by sound alone is the best of any owl species that scientists have tested. The North American subspecies of barn owl is the largest.===Meet Sarada, a large fan-throated lizard only found in India. Discovered in 2016, its dewlap extends along 59% of its trunk having colors yellow, iridescent blue, black and orange. It is the sister genus of Sitana and is only found in 2 Indian states - Maharashtra and Karnataka.===The Guianan Rupicola rupicola is found in tropical mountainous regions of the northeastern part of South America. The orange-plumaged male has a striking half-moon crest, an orange-tipped black tail, black, orange and white wings, and silky-orange filaments of the inner remiges.===The Antilles pinktoe tarantula (Caribena versicolor) or the Martinique red tree spider is popular as a spider pet because of its docile character and unique coloration. The natural habitat of this spider is in the trees and shrubs of Martinique in the Caribbean.===The female platypus does not have nipples. Instead of nursing her young, milk from her mammary glands goes through pores in her abdomen and stays in folds in her skin, which her babies then drink.===The meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis) is one of the most frequent hosts in Europe parasitized by the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus). The cuckoo normally removes one or more of the host eggs and replaces them with one of its own, however, studies show the pipit has made adaptions against parasitism.===When interested in the display of the male, the female Big Dipper (Photinus Pyralis, Common Eastern Firefly) replies with a short pulse of her heart-shaped lantern.===Raccoons have exceptional senses, namely tactile, hearing and night vision. The sensation in their hands is so developed that you can often seem them fondle their food to find any parts that shouldn't be eaten===The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) is a species of humpback dolphin inhabiting coastal waters of the eastern Indian and western Pacific Oceans. In the area of Hong Kong, the dolphin has pink skin which takes its color from subcutaneous blood vessels used for thermoregulation.===Opossums are North America's only marsupial,and they are omnivores meaning they'll eat everything from insects, grass and fruit to mice, birds and snakes to roadkill and the contents of garbage bins===The most commonly seen robber flies are dark in color, but some common types are orange. Several species even mimic bumble bees, with black and yellow stripes.",
