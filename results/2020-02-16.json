You'll be more relaxed, fall asleep easier, and have fewer bad dreams.===LPT: If a normally thoughtful person has forgotten to send you a greeting on an important date (e.g. Birthday, Anniversary), consider checking on them rather than condemning them for forgetting.===LPT:Stop trying to reach your goals by taking shortcuts, as you will feel more discouraged when they don't work as you expect them to. Fulfilling goals is a time-consuming process; you should spend more time visualizing yourself reaching your goals rather than looking for shortcuts to get you there.===LPT : no one can know in advance which choice will be the best. What‚Äôs important is what comes after making the best out of your choice. If the path you‚Äôve chosen brings about something bad, That‚Äôs all the more reason for you to work harder to proceed. Take responsibility for them and keep moving on===LPT: If someone asks you an inappropriate question===LPT: Place a damp paper towel over your food before you microwave it and it will help keep the food moist.===LPT - instead of saying \"i should do this\", say \"i'm going to do this\"===LPT If you have a strong opinion of something, it can come across as argumentative and turn people off immediately. If your opinion isn‚Äôt going to change, don‚Äôt expect someone else‚Äôs opinion to change. Share your thought instead of trying to change someone‚Äôs mind. Be polite and agree to disagree.===[LPT] Break bad habits by visualizing escape routines===LPT: enhance the effectiveness of your vacuum cleaner===LPT - If you're preparing for a competitive exam, remember that as important it is to attempt new questions, it is equally/more important to revisit the ones you got wrong while practicing. Not only will it cement those concepts but also the time you had spent doing them will actually be worth it.===LPT: When going to the hospital for injury, call your insurance asap. Most plans don't cover nearly as much if you go home before surgery, for example. It can cost you thousands out of pocket.===LPT: If you're watching Netflix on Chrome, Firefox or Opera, use Edge or Safari instead for full 1080p or up to 4k experience.===LPT: Endurance exercise can be hard, but the obstacles to success are largely psychological. Pushing past the initial pain and exhaustion and committing to ‚Äújust a little further‚Äù over and over can help you acclimate to the discomfort and reach your goals.===LPT: Before you close a bank account, report a \"lost debit card\" and request a new one, then close the account. This way you can avoid reoccurring charges you forgot to disable from reopening the account===LPT: Walk your dogs everywhere, dogs are great icebreakers to meet new people, and the dogs get their exercise. Win-win===LPT: Got stood up? Don't waste your bouquet by throwing it in the trash, just give it to the nearest person===LPT: If an item you‚Äôre buying has a coupon taped to it, peel it off and place it over the item‚Äôs barcode. The cashier can then scan the coupon when scanning the item and you won‚Äôt forget the coupon.===LPT: save recordings of voicemails from loved ones===LPT: Swallow and hold your breath to stop hiccuping instantly on your own===LPT: When you cuddle with or pet your cat, say their name often. This will make them want to come to you when called in the future.===LPT use msconfig on Windows computers to see all services that auto start.===LPT: When vacuuming around dressers, take the bottom drawer out. If it's open to the floor, vacuum there too.",

It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===Notice: As of 2/10/2020, we are requiring sources (in comments) for trivial details.===In Rogue One (2016), director Gareth Edwards told the main characters and extras to grow moustaches and sideburns to give the film a 1970‚Äôs feel, and add a retro-futuristic aesthetic like the original trilogy did.===In The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) Director Tobe Hooper kept Gunnar Hansen's (the actor who plays Leatherface) costume and mask a secret from the cast. Allen Danziger's scream when he first sees the brutal killer is real &amp; genuine.===In Scott Pilgrim vs The World (2010) Scott wears a Plumtree shirt at the start of the movie. Plumtree was a Canadian band that wrote a song called ‚ÄúScott Pilgrim‚Äù which was the inspiration for the comic books written by Bryan Lee O‚ÄôMalley which inspired the director Edgar Wright to make the movie.===In A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon (2019), a shot of security monitors shows that the bottom 3 are numbered 4, 20, and 69.===In J. J. Abrams' Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013), R2-D2 can be spotted flying past the screen amidst debris from damaged starships.===In The Lego Movie 2: The second part (2019) the end credits has Lego figures of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton holding hands.===In Captain America Winter Soldier (2014) when Steve Rogers is making his PA announcement revealing that SHIELD has been compromised by Hydra, he states that they ‚Äúshot Nick Fury‚Äù rather than ‚Äúkilled Nick Fury‚Äù because he claimed earlier that he is always honest.===For the Chestburster scene in Alien (1979) the effects used to achieve the scene were deliberately kept secret from the actors who's reactions of surprise and shock were completely genuine===In The Martian (2015), the video log overlays show pressure in PSI (pounds per square inch), which is an imperial measurement. Real life NASA uses the metric system.===In Doctor Sleep (2019), the room that Danny is interviewed in is almost identical to the one Jack was interviewed in, in The Shining (1980)===In Coming to America (1988) during the breakfast scene you can see that the toast slices have had their crusts torn off, a true sign of luxury===In Avengers: Endgame (2019) the first to be snapped away is Hawkeye‚Äôs family and the birds chirping in the background. When Hulk brings everyone back the first we see come back are Hawkeye‚Äôs family and birds.===In Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) Monica Belluci plays a bride of Dracula. In The Matrix Reloaded (2003) as Persephone/Belluci enters the library, the movie playing in the background is The Brides of Dracula (1960).===In Batman v Superman (2016), before Lex Luthor is arrested he turns the painting in his father‚Äôs office upside down (right) which foreshadows the events of Justice League, demons coming from the sky (Apokoliptians), while angels come out of the ground (Superman).===In Toy Story (1995), Sid has a book called the \"Department of the Army Technical Manual: Improvised Interrogation Handbook\"===In The Devil's Advocate (1997), Keanu Reeves' character is billed at \"$400 an hour,\" which happens to be $6.66 a minute.===In Die Hard (1988), when filming Gruber‚Äôs death scene, Rickman was told he would be dropped on the count of three. The director counted to two before dropping him, making his reaction genuine.===In The African Queen (1951), Katherine Hepburn only drank water throughout production as a protest against John Huston and Humphrey Bogart‚Äôs alcoholism. However, most of the cast and crew became sick from the water and only Bogart and Huston were unaffected because they only drank whiskey.===In Snow White and the Seven Dwarves (1937), while Grumpy is being forcibly washed, Sneezy comments that he smells like a Petunia.

      "aggregatedTitles": "===Spotted Hyena milk has the highest protein and fat content of any terrestrial carnivore.===Honduran white bats (Ectophylla alba) or Caribbean white tent-making bats, create their own daytime sleeping quarters by using their teeth to cut the ribs of large leaves causing them to fold down to form a tent. They appear as white puffballs when they gather in groups. The bats mostly eat figs.===Pink-necked green pigeons are incubated by both parents for 17 days. They leave the nest 10 days after hatching, but continue to be fed by their parents for a few days until independent.===The trunk is used to drink, smell, pick up food, touch and communicate - this baby elephant is discovering their trunk===Birth of an octopus: Female octopuses lay their eggs and painstakingly weave them together into strands or clumps. They are very doting mothers and often guard the eggs for weeks, months and sometimes as long as a year.===The Pinocchio lizard (Anolis proboscis) was first discovered in 1953 in Ecuador (only a single male specimen) and it wasn't until 2004 that more lizards were found. It is critically endangered and inhabits a very small sliver of forest habitat in the Choc√≥ where it resides high in the tree canopy.===This is the Japanese raccoon dog, also known as a Tanuki in Japanese. It is sometimes classified as its own species due to unique features absent in mainland raccoon dogs.===The small elephant hawk moth (Deilephila porcellus) gets its common name for the caterpillar head's resemblance to an elephant's trunk. Hawk moths are also known as sphinx moths because the caterpillar resembles the Great Sphinx of Giza when resting. They are found in Europe and northern Africa.===Four new species of epaulette walking sharks were recently discovered off the coast of Australia and Papua New Guinea which are able to travel short distances over land because of their ability to walk using their pectoral fins and live in low to no oxygen conditions for extended periods of time.===Barn Owls are well-known for their distinctive heart-shaped face, which helps funnel sound towards their ears like a satellite dish. Their ears are asymmetrical, meaning that one is higher than the other, and this helps them locate the precise location of prey in the dark.===This Manta Ray, named Inspector Clouseau, is the only known pink specimen. Researchers think the pink color results from an unusual expression of Melanin - the common protein that's involved in skin-tanning, albinism and melanism (melanism is why panthers are pitch black)===The purple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis) is a rather stout-looking amphibian endemic to the Western Ghats of India. Because the frog only visibly appears above ground for a matter of days following the monsoon season, it was long overlooked by science, being only formally described in 2003.===Major Mitchell's cockatoo (Lophochroa leadbeateri) is notable for its soft-textured white and salmon-pink plumage and large bright red and golden-yellow crest. Its habitat is restricted to arid and semi-arid inland areas of Australia. These birds are known to live for longer than 80 years.===Barn owls, like all owls, stagger the laying of their eggs, with approximately 2-3 days between each egg. With an average clutch size of 5-7 eggs by the time the youngest hatches the oldest can already be 2 weeks old.===The Indian paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone paradisi) is an eye-catching bird (especially the male of the white morph subspecies) owing to its two central tail feathers which extend into streamers that are commonly twice as long as the its body. It is a commonly seen bird in various parts of Asia.===Barred Owls are a mid-sized owl that are sometimes preyed upon by Great Horned Owls (an apex predator often called \"Tigers of the Sky\"). Barred Owl hoots follow a simple pattern that sounds like \"Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you all?\"===American black bears ironically show a great deal of color variation. These colors range from jet black, to various shades of brown and gray. There also exist white black bears, which are nicknamed \"spirit bears\".===The Amazonian royal flycatcher (Onychorhynchus coronatus) is an infrequently seen bird found in the forests and woodlands throughout most of the Amazon basin bearing a striking red hammerhead crest when displayed. Their nests generally hang over water making it difficult for predators to reach.===Screech Owls can be either red or gray, to blend in with different shades of tree bark. They like to keep their eyes almost shut to help camouflage===Red-shouldered hawks are easily identified by their frequent, noisy calls, their distinct markings, and the translucent crescents near their wingtips. Caution must be used when identifying these vocal birds by sound alone; blue jays can convincingly mimic their calls.===The beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) is an Arctic and sub-Arctic cetacean, and it is easily recognizable thanks to its stark white coloring and globular head. The word \"beluga\" comes from the Russian work \"bielo\" which means white. Belugas are interestingly capable of swimming backwards.===Bushbabies are any of several species of small attractive arboreal primates native to sub-Saharan Africa. The animals are ace jumpers, using powerful legs and extremely long tails to spring great distances. Also known as galagos, these mammals are mostly nocturnal have excellent night vision.===Bald Eagles do not get their signature white head and tail until they are 4-5yrs old. This Bald Eagle is not even a year old yet. It was born in Spring 2019. The best way to age a juvenile Bald Eagle is by the beak color and the amount of white on it. This one's beak is almost all black===The pygmy marmoset (Cebuella pygmaea) is the smallest monkey in the world and lives in the rainforests of the western Amazon Basin in South America. They are quite affectionate and are often seen grooming each other for hours on end. This baby marmoset is no bigger than the size of a human thumb.===Painted wolves populations in the Okavango Delta have been observed \"rallying\" before they set out to hunt. Not every rally results in a departure, but departure becomes more likely when more dogs \"sneeze\". When members of dominant mating pairs sneeze first, the group is much more likely to depart.",
