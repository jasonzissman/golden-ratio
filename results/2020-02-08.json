This is reflected by the fact that they all have the number 0 on their basketball jerseys.===In Toy Story 4 [2019], Gabby Gabby's eyes wobble slightly in her head as she moves, a characteristic of dolls that close their eyes when lying on their backs. This eye movement is noticeably reduced as we learn more about her character, effectively \"humanizing\" her as the movie goes on.===It’s not said in Forrest Gump, but in the sequel book, the author reveals that Jenny dies from Hep C in the early 70s.

Lincoln takes a pie to the back of the head, which is how he was assassinated.===In Joker (2019), Bruce Wayne is introduced with a shot of him sliding down a pole.
