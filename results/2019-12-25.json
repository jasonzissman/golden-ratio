They‚Äôre extremely useful for tradesmen‚Äôs tool boxes, as they help prevent rust, or other areas in which you want to keep moisture content down.===LPT: want to be the best gift giver in your family? Start a notes file on your phone and whenever a family member or friend mentions something they‚Äôd like/need or think is cool during the year, write it down under their name. Now whenever a holiday comes up you have a list of items to choose from.===LPT: Always carry a multi-tool or Swiss Army Knife around during the holidays for all your friends and families gifts that require unsealing, unscrewing, or unwinding.===LPT: Have a person in your life that makes a certain phenomenal dish on special occasions? Ask them to make the dish with you so you can learn their recipe, ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù, and techniques. It will create a special memory and you will be able to carry on the tradition.===LPT: Don't forget to break down the boxes that all your fun new Christmas gifts came in so they can fit in the trash can. The last this you want is a big TV box next to your trash can on the street to advertise your newly acquired goods to burglars!===LPT: Check up on those spending Christmas alone. This could be a very difficult time of the year for them and they will appreciate someone looking out for them===LPT: If you get any gift cards that you don't plan on using for Christmas just save them till next Christmas and buy them something from that store.===LPT: thinking of getting a gift card for a kid in your family? Give them a stack of $1 bills worth the same amount.===LPT: For Women, if you've had a period bleed through clothes, just drench the area with dilduted hydrogen peroxide and wait 30 seconds. The blood will fizz up and then you can wipe the blood away and there will be no color stripping.===LPT: Added too much lemon juice to something? Use a little bit of baking soda to counteract the acidity and bring the pH back down. Sugar won't fix the problem.===LPT When calling a store, ask the hours, not if they're open.===LPT: When stashing something for \"safe-keeping,\" take a picture of it in case you forget where you put it===LPT: When heating up a drink in a microwave, don't put it in the middle of the spinning plate. Drinks are often undisturbed when put inside and don't heat up equally. If you put it at the edge of the plate, the drink will slowly stir itself because of the plate's spinning. Not much, but there.===LPT: Use this holiday as an opportunity to check your family's fire alarms and fire extinguishers. They often are forgotten and with all the candles and lights this season they are that much more important===LPT : If you are asked to create an account in order to continue browsing a website, hit F12 and click on the dim area, this would select it and you can delete it with DEL key, hit F12 again and resume your browsing.===LPT: If you get a Visa/MasterCard gift card for Christmas, and don't want to use it/deal with a balance left on it, afraid you'll forget to use it, etc. buy yourself an Amazon gift card through Amazon. You can use the full amount and immediately add the balance to your account.===LPT: If you keep having the similar typing-errors when typing on your phone, go to settings -&gt; general -&gt; keyboard -&gt; text replacement, then change your commonly misspelled word to what you want it to be.===LPT: Don't assume people don't like anything (Christmas) because they are lonely. Instead start a healthy conversation about their wants, you may find out more about your friends, deepen those friendships, and save yourself time money and effort in searching for unwanted gifts.===LPT: If a song isn't available on spotify try looking for a podcast instead, there's often someone who uploaded the song disguised as a podcast instead.===LPT: If you want to find alternatives to something, start to type \"[thing] vs\" in Google, and take a look at what suggestions pop up===LPT: Always check the ethnic aisle for spices before baking aisle. You can usually find twice the amount for half the price===LPT: Remember when opening gifts this holiday season that no one likes a good guesser.===LPT: When being thanked for a gift you gave, avoid saying it was nothing, or that it was on sale. Instead, tell the person receiver that you got it because of what they mean to you. This way, you amplify your efforts by making receiver feel like they are not just an afterthought.",
