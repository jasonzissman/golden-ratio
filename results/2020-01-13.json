The participants tended to express a high level of emotionality when recalling their experiences with the news. Many also reported feeling overwhelmed, anxious or angry.===A new study, conducted in mice, suggests anxious people who turn to marijuana to cope with stress may be 2-AG deficient, and could lead to novel therapies for anxiety. The 2-AG molecule dampens communication between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, reducing anxiety.===Engineering team invents novel Direct Thermal Charging Cell for Converting low-grade waste heat to usable electricity. This technology taps into the massive potential of recycling low-grade heat as an energy source that can be used all over the world and help reduce overall industrial emissions===After mass shootings, Republican-controlled state legislatures double the number of laws that *loosen* gun regulations. Mass shootings do not have any impact on the number of gun control bills that Democratic-controlled legislatures pass.===Captured carbon dioxide could be used to extract useful metals from recycled technology such as smartphone batteries rather than just being buried underground. The technique could help make it more economical to capture the greenhouse gas before it enters the atmosphere.===Scientists find meteorite pieces that are about 2.4 billion years older than the solar system. The evidence comes from 50 tiny grains taken from the Murchison meteorite, which fell to Australia in 1969, and they suggest the Milky Way experienced a burst of star formation some 7 billion years ago.===When it comes to heat in the top 2,000m of the ocean, 2019 was not only the warmest year on record, it displayed the largest single-year increase of the entire decade, a sobering reminder that human-caused heating of our planet continues unabated===Quest to use CRISPR against disease gains ground===Scientists use stem cells from frogs to build first living robots. \"These are novel living machines.

As robot workers become more salient, intergroup differences‚Äîincluding racial and religious differences‚Äîmay seem less important, fostering a perception of common human identity.===New study suggests dwindling wealth gap between college grads and non-college grads. Among minorities there is no statistically significant wealth gap between those with a four year degree and those without===Drosophila kept in total darkness had \"severe\" long-term memory impairments compared to those exposed to normal light cycles. Scientists suggest that light promotes the release of neuropeptides related to long-term memory formation and argue light is \"essential\" for maintaining long-term memory.===World Premiere in Zurich: Machine keeps human livers alive for one week===A study recently published in the journal Sex Roles sheds new light on the relationship between selfie behaviors, self-objectification, and depressive symptoms in women.

It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===In 1408 (2007), the wine that Olin has is called \"Les Cinquant Sept D√©c√®s,\" which means \"The 57 Deaths.\" Olin had previously and repeatedly mentioned that 56 people had gone and died in 1408, which suggests that Mike was doomed to go die from the start.===In ‚ÄúThe Dark Knight‚Äù (2008), one character is a possible nod to the villain The Riddler. Coleman Reese (Joshua Harto) deduces Batman‚Äôs identity with little effort, like The Riddler has in the comics. He‚Äôs also addressed as ‚ÄúMr. Reese,‚Äù a homonym of mysteries like how the Riddler is E. Nygma/enigma===In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) before Harry gets sucked into Tom riddles diary, he‚Äôs in a candle lit room. When he‚Äôs in the diary, everything is in black and white yet, we can still see the candle light flickering on his body===In Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018), when Miles shocks Peter, his nervous system is highlighted instead of the usual bones portrayal===In The Phantom Menace (1999) the slave girl to the right is wearing the exact same costume that Princess Leia does in The Return of the Jedi (1983)===In The Great Gatsby (2013), while Tom is cheating on his wife in the other room, Nick waits on a couch embroidered with Fragonard's The Swing. This painting depicts adultery (explanation in comments).===In 1408 (2007), in the scene where the room calls and tells Mike Enslin to use their express check out service, it shows a rope tied into a noose. When he sees an illusion of him using it, the rope is replaced with the room's towels tied together since the rope is not part of the room.===In Scott Pilgrim vs The World (2010), Scott asks for a list of her Evil Exes, and she sarcastically says she might get it laminated. When she does give him the list, it is in fact laminated.===In Avengers Endgame (2019) Stan lee drives a car, in the back of the car you can notice a phrase \"NUFF SAID\" which was one of the famous quote said by Stan Lee===In A New Hope (1977) you can see David Prowse through Darth Vader‚Äôs non tinted eye cutouts===In \"Concussion\" (2015), while NFL player Mike Webster visits his former team doctor at his clinic office, Mike is calmed and placed next to the skull of a woodpecker, an animal known to withstand repetitive blows to the head.===Training Day (2001): at the mexican's, Hoyt is asked what kind of gun he packs. He says \"a 9mm Beretta\" (reglamentary gun of LAPD) and Smiley immediately replies \"like this one?\" and shows his own stainless Beretta (also LAPD gun). Hoyt was most likely not the first cop to get the bathtub treatment===Sideways (2004) The wine Miles saved for a special occasion then wound up drinking at a fast food restaurant is Chateau Cheval Blanc, a wine that is predominantly Merlot===In \"The Lighthouse\" (2019) director Robert Eggers makes a costume choice that has dark implications to the previous scene it is shown in. The details are spoilers, so check comments for details.===In the opening of O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000) something that subtly adds to the mystique of the Blind Seer is how soon his slow handcar followed the train in the middle of nowhere. It's as if he and his handcar appeared out of thin air offscreen.===In American Pie (1999), the orgasm manual is located in the ‚ÄúFluid Dynamics‚Äù section of the library===In The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976) starring David Bowie, Bryce walks past Bowies most recently released album 'Young Americans' in the record store.===In The Founder(2016), you can see Ray Kroc look on a map to find San Bernadino. This map is inaccurate as it shows Irvine, CA, a city formally incorporated in 1971.===In the movie \"The Invention of Lying\" (2009) you can see the crowd is computer generated. Look the the people to the right of each white line.===In Collateral (2004), after committing his first murder of the evening, Vincent (Tom Cruise) calls Max (Jamie Foxx) Lady Macbeth for trying to clean up his cab after becoming involved in the murder. This is in reference to Lady Macbeth trying to clean her hands after her involvement in a murder.===In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) Harry casts the spell Arania Exumai against the spiders in the forest. He learns this by watching Tom Riddle cast it against Aragog in the past.===In Zombieland: Double Tap (2019) when Tallahassee and Columbus meet their mirror images, it‚Äôs a direct reference to a scene in the original zom-com (zombie comedy), Shaun Of The Dead, when the same thing happens to Shaun and his friends.===In The Incredibles (2004), Gazerbeam can be seen at Bob and Ellen‚Äôs wedding. Later in the film, we see Sydrome‚Äôs henchmen have a very similar outfits. This is probably due to Gazerbeam being the first super to be killed because of Operation Kronos.===In The Muppet Movie (1979), Kermit assures Animal that his ‚Äúbig scene‚Äù is happening soon.===In Reservoir Dogs (1992), Mr Orange is told that to make a story convincing he has to know every detail. Later, while driving, Nice Guy Eddie tells a story about a cocktail waitress and her abusive boyfriend, but cannot give details when asked by Mr Orange. This suggests Eddie is a bullshitter.",
