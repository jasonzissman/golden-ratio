Take a few deep breaths and choose to move on with your life.===LPT: When picking a nursing or assisted living facility ask EMS.===LPT: Whenever you talk to someone in customer service on the phone, write down their name when they tell it to you at the start of the call so you remember it. It's really great to be able to tell them \"thank you so-and-so\" when you're finished talking with them and it definitely makes their day.===LPT: Taking a silent pause always sounds more professional than saying “umm”. Get in the practice of pausing while thinking rather than using filler words.===LPT: You can use your selfie camera to get a better view when you have to plug cables in behind something and you can't properly see, like a TV.===LPT: Don't use Netflix on Google Chrome.

If it goes to music you are actually on hold!===LPT: when visiting your grandparents, ask them to teach you something that's interesting or important to them. Chatting is fine, but asking for something specific shows you care about them, and gives them a chance to feel purpose===LPT: do not, under any circumstances, take a black-out-drunk stranger back home with you.

Female grizzlies delay pregnancy until hibernation, and in preparation for this they can gain approximately 400 pounds (or 180 kg). A typical litter size ranges from 1 to 4 cubs every 3 or more years.===Octopus Wolfi, the smallest octopus species in the world, is smaller than an inch (2.5 cm) long and weighs less than a gram.===Though often called the koala “bear,” this cuddly animal is not a bear at all; it is a marsupial, or pouched mammal. After giving birth, a female koala carries her baby in her pouch for about six months.===Bald eagles are well equipped to deal with extreme temperatures. Their adaptations include lowering their nocturnal body temperature, minimizing movement, or communal roosting.===Dogs are born with front dew claws. Research suggests that they're the least frequently injured digit and removing it nearly doubles a dog's chance of injuring any of the remaining digits.===Nudibranchs are grouped with snails and slugs in the class Gastropoda. Their bright colors warn predators of the Nudi’s chemical defenses. They do not secrete these chemicals naturally, but obtain them from their food sources, particularly sponges.===Dik diks mark their territory by crying and other cute facts about the Dik diks===Red pandas use their tails as wraparound blankets in the chilly mountain heights.===The Panther Chameleons have a long prehensile tail which acts as a ‘fifth limb’ and gives them balance when climbing trees.

Here's their microscopic ℜ𝔬𝔪𝔞𝔫𝔠𝔢.===This is a Golden Tiger. The colour of their fur coat is result of a extremely rare recessive gene.===In 1958, filmmakers for Disney's documentary \"White Wilderness\" imported Lemmings and staged a mass suicide - perpuating a myth that this was a common, natural behavior of the Lemmings.===Only 1 in 3000 Calicos Are Male Cats. Despite Popular Myth, There Is No Additional Value To Them Being Male, As They Are Sterile.===Squirrels have been observed engaging in “deceptive caching.” This is where a squirrel digs a hole and vigorously covers it up again, but without depositing the nut. It seems this is done to throw off potential food thieves.===Sword Billed Hummingbird is the only bird species with a bill length that exceeds the body length.===Hovering birds such as kestrels have an accessory optic system that is relatively several times larger than most other birds===When an infant koala – called a joey – is born, it immediately climbs up to its mother’s pouch. Blind and earless, a joey uses its strong sense of touch and smell, as well as natural instinct, to find its way.===Gannets have several important adaptations for diving; no external nostrils, air sacs in the face and chest under the skin which act like bubble wrapping, cushioning the impact with the water and forward facing eyes for binocular vision. They dive from 30 m (98 ft) up at speeds of 100 kmph (62 mph).===Although it has long been thought that reptiles lack the cognitive complexity to engage in play behavior, recent studies have suggested that reptiles from a wide variety of different taxa may benefit from toys and other environmental enrichment===Manatees aren’t endangered anymore fun fact.
