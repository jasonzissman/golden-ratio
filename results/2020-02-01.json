The first time was enough.===LPT If you‚Äôre facing a large task, break it down into small jobs. I.E. ‚ÄúClean Room‚Äù versus ‚Äúpick up laundry‚Äù, ‚Äúmake bed‚Äù, ‚Äúvacuum carpet‚Äù etc small tasks are easier to comprehend and thus easier to accomplish. Checking little things off also will provide some dopamine to spur you forward.===LPT: Just because someone has children or is pregnant doesn't mean they aren't a complete idiot. Be careful who you take advice from.===LPT: Don‚Äôt get scared while watching horror movies by rooting for the antagonist===LPT: always wash your clothes before donating them to thrift shops===LPT: Before opening a jar of nuts, turn it upside down and tap it a few times. This will bring all the salt and seasoning to the top.===LPT: Take some time for yourself at least once a week. Taking a fifteen to thirty minute hot shower or bath will do wonders for your mental health and stress.===LPT: When someone informs you of a mistake you made, often an apology is all they are after. Making excuses/getting defensive or offended will usually just result in an argument.===LPT: If someone wrongly accuses you of something, don‚Äôt act angry and yell about it; being overly defensive and dramatic makes you look guilty. Just respond like you are puzzled/confused by the accusation.===LPT: Take care of your feet. Buy good boots and shoes for work .===LPT: My mom and I do this game where you say why you‚Äôre grateful for negative things and it helps us shift our perspectives a lot===LPT: If you or your partner are a blanket-hog, buy a blanket one size up from your bed so there is enough to go around===LPT: Calm down about getting the Coronavirus if you live outside China. The media loves to freak out over the tinniest of things. The Coronavirus infected 12000 people yet only 250 died. Which means only 2% died from it. While with Ebola about 50% died. While Ebola alone killed 11,000.===LPT: If your car‚Äôs gas pedal ever gets stuck, shift your car into neutral and then apply your breaks===LPT: a services making it hard to cancel your subscription/membership, just block the charge on your credit card.===LPT - Wash your dishwasher filter regularly!===LPT: If you have a nut butter with oil sitting on top, flip the container upside-down. Gravity will pull the butter down and the oil will force its way through it, making the butter creamy!===LPT: \"I appreciate you\"/\"Thank you for that, I appreciate you\" goes a lot further and means more than \"Thanks, I appreciate it\" when someone does something for you.===LPT: buy sliced pepperoni from the salad bar at the grocery store to save money===LPT: Thrift stores, especially larger chain stores, are often a goldmine for like-new expensive art supplies like oil paint or books of watercolor paper.===LPT: Refill propane tanks at places such as Tractor Supply Co vs exchanging tanks somewhere.===LPT: When you remove your quilt cover from your bed, button it back up before you put it in the washing machine and dryer. That way, clothes and other bits of washing don't get caught up inside the duvet during the spin.===LPT: Don't buy \"brand new in box\" Apple products second hand people are buying cheap Chinese clones and reselling as authentic===LPT: If you need a lot of sesame seeds, buy them at Asian markets.===LPT: When baking a cake from a box, add an extra egg to the recipe to make it nice and moist.===LPT: Do not ever expect people to do the *right* thing",
