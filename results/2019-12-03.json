An average of 25,000 infants per year were born earlier as a result of hot weather, with a loss of more than 150,000 gestational days annually in the United States from 1969 to 1988===A new study could explain why some individuals are susceptible to anhedonia, the lack of pleasurable feeling that accompanies depression. Rats susceptible to anhedonia had more serotonergic neurons. Activating another population of neurons decreased serotonin signaling and reduced those symptoms.===Our ability to recognize dogs‚Äô emotions is shaped by our cultural upbringing, suggests a new study.

More importantly, some disclaimers heightened and even harmed body dissatisfaction in at-risk women, the study showed.===Calculations now show that fireball which passed over the Australian desert in 2016 may have likely been a \"mini-moon\", an object which was temporarily captured in orbit before plummeting to Earth almost vertically.===Lack of tolerance, institutional confidence threaten democracies. Where confidence in institutions such as the government and the media is low, democracy tends to be unstable.

Gandalf also refers to him as a snake multiple times===In Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), Luke winks at C-3PO when he arrives at the abandoned rebel base on Crait.
