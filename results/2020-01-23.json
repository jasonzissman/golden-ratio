Eli is a 🔒 HOFer @Giants===[Lombardi] - Patrick Mahomes didn’t even know Jimmy Garoppolo, but he found him at Arrowhead Stadium after Garoppolo tore his ACL last season to offer well wishes. \"For him to do something as simple as that, it went a long way,” Garoppolo said of Mahomes.===[Valkenburg] My favorite Eli Manning anecdote is when Rory McIlroy was at the gym at 6 am during the Masters and Brady and the Mannings walked in and Rory told the press later: Wow it was so inspiring to see how Tom and Peyton grind during the off-season, just so cool. And Eli was there also.===[Rauch] Family source also tells me Joe Burrow would never “pull an Eli Manning” if drafted No. 1 by the #Bengals. The family has been a bit annoyed by that narrative.===[Dianna] Drew Brees on Eli Manning “you can not write the story of the NFL without including Eli Manning.” #giants===[Rapoport] The #Vikings are turning to a familiar face for their new OC: Gary Kubiak, who has been an assistant head coach and offensive advisor, is taking over as the offensive coordinator, sources say. His impact was felt quickly in Minnesota and now he sticks around.===[Barrows] - “I don’t wear it.
