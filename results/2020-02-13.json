      "aggregatedTitles": "===American black bears ironically show a great deal of color variation. These colors range from jet black, to various shades of brown and gray. There also exist white black bears, which are nicknamed \"spirit bears\".===Barred Owls are a mid-sized owl that are sometimes preyed upon by Great Horned Owls (an apex predator often called \"Tigers of the Sky\"). Barred Owl hoots follow a simple pattern that sounds like \"Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you all?\"===Screech Owls can be either red or gray, to blend in with different shades of tree bark. They like to keep their eyes almost shut to help camouflage===The Amazonian royal flycatcher (Onychorhynchus coronatus) is an infrequently seen bird found in the forests and woodlands throughout most of the Amazon basin bearing a striking red hammerhead crest when displayed. Their nests generally hang over water making it difficult for predators to reach.===Bushbabies are any of several species of small attractive arboreal primates native to sub-Saharan Africa. The animals are ace jumpers, using powerful legs and extremely long tails to spring great distances. Also known as galagos, these mammals are mostly nocturnal have excellent night vision.===Red-shouldered hawks are easily identified by their frequent, noisy calls, their distinct markings, and the translucent crescents near their wingtips. Caution must be used when identifying these vocal birds by sound alone; blue jays can convincingly mimic their calls.===The beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) is an Arctic and sub-Arctic cetacean, and it is easily recognizable thanks to its stark white coloring and globular head. The word \"beluga\" comes from the Russian work \"bielo\" which means white. Belugas are interestingly capable of swimming backwards.===Bald Eagles do not get their signature white head and tail until they are 4-5yrs old. This Bald Eagle is not even a year old yet. It was born in Spring 2019. The best way to age a juvenile Bald Eagle is by the beak color and the amount of white on it. This one's beak is almost all black===The pygmy marmoset (Cebuella pygmaea) is the smallest monkey in the world and lives in the rainforests of the western Amazon Basin in South America. They are quite affectionate and are often seen grooming each other for hours on end. This baby marmoset is no bigger than the size of a human thumb.===Painted wolves populations in the Okavango Delta have been observed \"rallying\" before they set out to hunt. Not every rally results in a departure, but departure becomes more likely when more dogs \"sneeze\". When members of dominant mating pairs sneeze first, the group is much more likely to depart.===The Dumbo octopus acquired its adorable name from its resemblance to the title character of Disney's 1941 film Dumbo because of the octopus' prominent ear-like fins which extend from the mantle above each eye. They are among the deepest dwelling octopuses in the ocean and are exceedingly rare.===The mating rituals of manta rays involve forming ‚Äòtrains‚Äô where the larger female is chased by several pursuing males who try to follow her fast and twisting movements. Whichever male can keep up the longest will gain the chance to mate.===Male American Kestrels arrive first to breeding grounds. As cavity nesters, kestrels utilize tree hollows, man-made buildings, or old woodpecker holes for nest sites. The males will seek out potential nest cavities and present them to the females, who make the final selection of a nesting place.===The grebes' leg movements are extremely fast. They take as many as 10 strides per second, which is faster than any other bird ever studied. They can run on water.===Unlike most reptiles, female alligators are actually very good and protective mothers. An alligator that is ready to lay eggs builds a large nest using mud, sticks and plants. She will lay 10-50 eggs on top of this nest and then cover them with more material. The decomposing plants warm the nest.===The eight-spotted crab spider (Platythomisus octomaculatus) is one of the most unnatural-looking spiders around with it highly contrasting black dots on a bright yellow abdomen. It was found in a forest preserve in Singapore in 1924, and it is among the largest crab spiders at one inch in length.===Baby cheetahs mimic the aggressive honey badgers in order to deter predators===Subtle variations in mobbing calls are predator-specific in great tits===Remoras' front dorsal fins have evolved to enable them to adhere by suction to the smooth surfaces of a host animal such as whale, turtle, shark or ray. Remoras get a free ride and protection, thus saving them valuable energy. The remora is doing its host a huge service by hoovering up parasites.===Onagadori is a historic Japanese breed of chicken, characterised by an exceptionally long tail, which consists of about 16‚Äì18 feathers, which under the right conditions never moult, and grow rapidly, gaining some 0.7‚Äì1.3 m per year.===Although hyenas may look like canines to many, they are actually classified in their own family that isn‚Äôt canid or felid, called Hyaenidae. However, being members of Feliformia, they are more closely related to cats than dogs. Instead of a pup, the young hyena pictured here is called a cub.===Incubator birds are Australian fowl that are quite unique - while all other birds use their body heat to incubate their eggs, incubator birds pile plant debris on their eggs and make use of the heat of composting to hatch their eggs. The bird periodically monitors the temperature of the mound.===The bearded reedling (Panurus biarmicus) is a small roundish bird native to Europe and Asia with the single largest population of around 500 nesting pairs residing in the marshy reed beds along the Tay River in Great Britain where they stay year round.===The Eurasian sparrowhawk is migratory in the north of its range, with these birds wintering in southern Europe, southern Asia and less commonly in Africa.===The red-crested turaco (Tauraco erythrolophus), the national bird of Angola, is one of the more colorful birds in its genus, and its call sounds somewhat like a jungle monkey. Turacos are found in large flocks and feed on ripe fruits. Interestingly, all flock members help new moms with \"childcare.\"",
