This is what could have been.===In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009), the spell books on the shelves in Dumbledore's office are actually Yellow Pages covered with old-looking bindings.===In The Devil's Advocate (1997), Keanu Reeves' character is billed at \"$400 an hour,\" which happens to be $6.66 a minute.===In Superbad (2007), the lead characters’ names Evan and Seth are named after the movie’s writers, Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg, who wrote the first draft of the script when they were 13 years old===In 'The Ninth Gate' (1999), the mystery girl reads the book \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\". Charles Manson used what he learned from the book in prison to manipulate women into killing on his behalf. He orchestrated the killing of Sharon Tate, director(of this film) Roman Polanski's wife.===In Hannibal Rising(2007), Hannibals mask is representative of a Oni mask. An oni is a demon in Japanese culture and usually eats people from different villages similar to Hannibal Lecter===Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood (2019): The sound of the milk carton put on the pick up truck bed represents the Chinese gong, meaning the fight is on (Observation, unconfirmed)===In A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon (2019), a shot of security monitors shows that the bottom 3 are numbered 4, 20, and 69.===In The Matrix (1999) the only member of the Nebuchadnezzar crew to vocalize a greeting when being introduced to Neo by Morpheus is the traitor, Cypher===The theme of line-crossing in Parasite (2019) - when ‘Jessica’ asks Mrs Park if something traumatic happened to her youngest child, the camera crosses the 180-degree line, putting Mrs Park and Jessica at the same frame positioning (right/right). This camera position stays throughout the scene.===In Goldfinger (1964) the gold obsessed villain wears either yellow clothing or gold jewellery in every scene he's in.===In The Dark Knight (2008), after the joker was arrested, his jacket is being searched by one of the police. The last knife shown being taken out of the jacket is actually a potato peeler.===In The Lego Movie 2: The second part (2019) the end credits has Lego figures of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton holding hands.===In Rogue One (2016), director Gareth Edwards told the main characters and extras to grow moustaches and sideburns to give the film a 1970’s feel, and add a retro-futuristic aesthetic like the original trilogy did.===In \"The Dark Knight Rises(2012)\" Miranda Tate about 33 minutes in after meeting Bruce Wayne for the first time mentions \"restoring balance to the world\" this phrase was mentioned many times in batman begins by \"ra's al ghul\" as the goal of the league of shadows, this is a clue to her associations.===In Goldfinger (1964), the main villain’s name is Auric Goldfinger - AU being the first two letters of his name and also the atomic symbol for gold on the periodic table===in Ford vs. Ferrari (2019) at the Daytona 24 race, Shelby Cobra holds up the sign \"7000+Go Like Hell\" sign.

The film's director, William Friedkin, watched him perform a cerebral angiography the previous year. The scene was praised for its realism.===In Kubrick's film \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971), the \"Dies Erie\" line is featured in the opening sequence, most used in film to cue the audience to peril or tragedy ahead. Nine years later the same melody is applied to the opening sequence of The Shining (1980), achieving the same result.===In Fight Club (1999), during the Narrator and Tyler's 2nd fight, the three men only looks at the Narrator===In the Emperor's New Groove (2000), after Yzma realizes that she transformed Kuzco into a llama instead of poisoning him, the cactus that she poured what she thought was poison into is shaped like a llama.",

      "aggregatedTitles": "===Pygmy seahorses are tiny fish that are nearly indistinguishable from their habitats due to their size and extreme camouflage. They are so well camouflaged that Bargibant’s pygmy seahorse was only discovered after a host gorgonian was collected and observed by marine biologist George Bargibant.===Harris's Hawks are sometimes called \"Wolves of the Sky\" because they hunt in packs like wolves. Their unique social nature also means that they may nest in group units or help injured \"packmates.\"===Screech Owls rely primarily on their hearing to hunt and evade predators. This guy was able to pass his live-prey test, and was successfully released after a stay at the rehab center===A baby hedgehog is called a hoglet and a group is called a prickle or an array. Unlike porcupine quills, their spikes are not barbed. They are partially immune to viper venom and, on rare occasions, they might attack and eat them.===Spotted Hyena milk has the highest protein and fat content of any terrestrial carnivore.===The pink katydid, first described by entomologists in 1887, is so rare that they occur only once out of every 500 individuals because of erythrism, a condition in which a recessive gene for the color pink becomes the dominant color for some members of the species, making them sadly easier prey.===The Philippine sail-fin lizard's most distinctive feature in adult males is the erect sail-like crest of skin at the base of their tail, up to 8 cm high, which provides propulsion for this strong swimmer to move through the water, and it probably also plays an important role in thermoregulation.===Honduran white bats (Ectophylla alba) or Caribbean white tent-making bats, create their own daytime sleeping quarters by using their teeth to cut the ribs of large leaves causing them to fold down to form a tent. They appear as white puffballs when they gather in groups. The bats mostly eat figs.===Pink-necked green pigeons are incubated by both parents for 17 days. They leave the nest 10 days after hatching, but continue to be fed by their parents for a few days until independent.===The fire-tailed titi monkey (Callicebus miltoni) was discovered in 2011 by a Brazilian primatologist in a small sliver of lowland rainforest south of the Amazon River. Since they are unable to swim or cross mountainous terrain, the monkeys are essentially confined to very small geographical area.===The Pinocchio lizard (Anolis proboscis) was first discovered in 1953 in Ecuador (only a single male specimen) and it wasn't until 2004 that more lizards were found. It is critically endangered and inhabits a very small sliver of forest habitat in the Chocó where it resides high in the tree canopy.===The rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta) is a threatened species of lizard primarily found on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, shared by the Republic of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Its name derives from the bony-plated pseudo-horn on its head which resembles the horn of a rhinoceros.===The trunk is used to drink, smell, pick up food, touch and communicate - this baby elephant is discovering their trunk===Birth of an octopus: Female octopuses lay their eggs and painstakingly weave them together into strands or clumps. They are very doting mothers and often guard the eggs for weeks, months and sometimes as long as a year.===The small elephant hawk moth (Deilephila porcellus) gets its common name for the caterpillar head's resemblance to an elephant's trunk. Hawk moths are also known as sphinx moths because the caterpillar resembles the Great Sphinx of Giza when resting. They are found in Europe and northern Africa.===This is the Japanese raccoon dog, also known as a Tanuki in Japanese. It is sometimes classified as its own species due to unique features absent in mainland raccoon dogs.===Four new species of epaulette walking sharks were recently discovered off the coast of Australia and Papua New Guinea which are able to travel short distances over land because of their ability to walk using their pectoral fins and live in low to no oxygen conditions for extended periods of time.===Barn Owls are well-known for their distinctive heart-shaped face, which helps funnel sound towards their ears like a satellite dish. Their ears are asymmetrical, meaning that one is higher than the other, and this helps them locate the precise location of prey in the dark.===This Manta Ray, named Inspector Clouseau, is the only known pink specimen. Researchers think the pink color results from an unusual expression of Melanin - the common protein that's involved in skin-tanning, albinism and melanism (melanism is why panthers are pitch black)===The purple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis) is a rather stout-looking amphibian endemic to the Western Ghats of India. Because the frog only visibly appears above ground for a matter of days following the monsoon season, it was long overlooked by science, being only formally described in 2003.===Major Mitchell's cockatoo (Lophochroa leadbeateri) is notable for its soft-textured white and salmon-pink plumage and large bright red and golden-yellow crest. Its habitat is restricted to arid and semi-arid inland areas of Australia. These birds are known to live for longer than 80 years.===Barn owls, like all owls, stagger the laying of their eggs, with approximately 2-3 days between each egg. With an average clutch size of 5-7 eggs by the time the youngest hatches the oldest can already be 2 weeks old.===The Indian paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone paradisi) is an eye-catching bird (especially the male of the white morph subspecies) owing to its two central tail feathers which extend into streamers that are commonly twice as long as the its body. It is a commonly seen bird in various parts of Asia.===Barred Owls are a mid-sized owl that are sometimes preyed upon by Great Horned Owls (an apex predator often called \"Tigers of the Sky\"). Barred Owl hoots follow a simple pattern that sounds like \"Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you all?\"===American black bears ironically show a great deal of color variation. These colors range from jet black, to various shades of brown and gray. There also exist white black bears, which are nicknamed \"spirit bears\".",
