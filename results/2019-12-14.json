They remain largely motionless and camouflaged in the muddy waters they inhabit, which allows them to ambush their prey.===The Rusty spotted cat is the worlds smallest cat weighing in at only 2.0-3.5 lb.===Lophosaurus dilophus, the crowned forest dragon or Indonesian forest dragon, is a large arboreal agamid lizard found in New Guinea and the Moluccan islands, Indonesia.===Tawny frogmouths form partnerships for life and usually stay in the same territory, establishing and maintaining physical contact is an integral part of their bonding process. Both parents share the duty of incubating their egg(s) as well as care for their young until they fledge.===The Tuatara is not a lizard, but actually the sole survivor of an order of reptiles dating back 200 million years ago. They are some of the slowest developing reptiles living today. Henry, Pictured, was still reproductively active at 111 years of age.===Bearded dragons are one of the most popular reptile pets due to their calm nature, but a little known fact about them is that they are actually venomous. Thankfully, their primitive venom, although related to rattlesnake toxins, is too weak to effect humans, but may be used to subdue their prey.===Kiwi are the only birds with external nostrils at the ends of their beaks. Their beaks are long and tipped with many sensor pits to detect worms and other invertebrates underground and in vegetation. Consequently, Kiwi can often be heard loudly snuffling and snorting to clear out their nostrils.===The New Mexican Whiptail is a species of lizard that is entirely female. They reproduce asexually, and lay eggs that will always result in female babies, which are genetic clones of the mother. Curiously, they still engage in ‘mating behaviour’ and courtship rituals with one another.===The corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus) is a North American species of rat snake that is named for the species' regular presence near grain stores, where it preys on mice and rats. They lack functional venom and help control populations of wild rodents that damage crops and spread disease.===The Portia Jumping Spider is remarkably intelligent, capable of problem solving and learning from experience. They can learn through trial and error to solve problems, and when hunting, can make detours to find the ‘best route’ to their prey, and even respond to positive and negative reinforcement.===The Russian Desman is a large, semiaquatic mole. Like other moles, it is functionally blind and obtains much of its sensory input from the touch-sensitive Eimer's organs at the end of its long snout.===The stone marten. These mustelids are closely related to otters and weasels. They usually inhabit the hills and forests of Central Europe, but have made headlines across Europe for starting electrical fires and have caused 63 million euros of damage in Germany alone===Opossums have prehensile tails, allowing them to gather leaves and grass as they build their nests, as well as opposable \"thumbs\" called hallux on all four feet!===This is a silver fox they are melanistic form of red fox _Vulpus vulpus_ . They were used in a Russian experiment to demonstrate how selective breeding works.===Chinchillas like to take dust baths===Juvenile plumage can make raptor identification difficult! Some species, such as the red-shouldered hawk pictured, typically obtain their adult plumage after just one year, but the markings and coloration can vary widely between individuals and regions.===Treehopper helmets depend on wing genes to grow, and can resemble thorns, leaves, even ants and wasps.===\"Young birds have no innate recognition of \"mother\". Rather, they identify with the first object they encounter that has certain key characteristics.\" In this case, the Pekin duck imprinted on a chicken.===Defense display of the non-venomous Rhombic Egg-eater, one of the few snakes completely without teeth.===Armadillo girdled lizards are one of only a few species of lizard that give birth to live young.===The red-crested turaco is the National Bird of Angola, and if you use one of its feathers to stir a glass of water, it will turn the water pink.===Tiger cubs are weaned at around 5-6 months. Staying with their mother until about 2 years old, they don't hunt alone until they leave their mother===Cougars have many vocalizations and they're able to purr. They're known for their blood curdling screams.",
