At different stages of its life, C. similis consumes leaves, flowers, fruit, insects, spiders, crabs, fish, rodents, hatchling sea turtles, lizards and their eggs, birds and their eggs, bats, and its own eggs and hatchlings.===This is the Pangolin. They're the only mammals with keratin scales, however unfortunately due to poaching they are also the most trafficked mammals in the world.===Outdoor temperature can be determined by counting the chirps made by crickets.===Salamander comes from the Greek word Fire Lizard, they’re nocturnal and capable of regeneration. Some of their tongues are up to 10 times their body length and some have teeth and can be poisonous.===If you threaten a spiny flower mantis, it will put its wings upwards to show the two eyes.===All hamsters have cheek pouches. These large pockets can stretch all the way back to a hamster's shoulders. The primary purpose of the pouches is to carry food from place to place.

They become opaque with age.===Aye-ayes tap on the trunks and branches of trees at a rate of up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers. Once a chamber is found, they chew a hole into the wood and get grubs out of that hole with their highly adapted narrow and bony middle finger.===Mountain chicken frog is a species of frog found in the Caribbean islands of Dominica and Montserrat. It is one of the world’s largest frogs. The species is terrestrial and nocturnal. Unlike most other amphibians which breed in water, this species breeds in underground burrows.===Mated pairs of birds may engage in a behavior called \"allopreening\" or mutual preening.
