It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===Notice: As of 2/10/2020, we are requiring sources (in comments) for trivial details.===In Star Wars: The Phantom Menace (1999) after the pod race you can see one of the tracking droids Darth Maul sent to find the queen in the background while Qui-Gon is talking to Watto.===In Aliens (1986) The Nostromo captain Dallas's bio is seen in the background. Former employers are Tyrell Corporation. The Synthetic building company from Blade Runner.===Fight Club (1999) When Edward Norton's Character receives a call from Tyler Durden. There's a sign on the phone booth indicating that it's not possible to receive incoming calls.===In the 1983 movie Scarface. The character Tony Montana can be seen eating a lemon which is for washing your hands after dinner. This shows how poor he was growing up never being exposed to things of the rich.===In Zombieland Double Tap (2019) After arriving to the Whitehouse, Woody Harrelson’s character pardons Wesley Snipes from tax evasion. Woody and Wesley starred in four movies together, including White Men Can’t Jump and Money Train.===In Monsters Inc. (2001), at the end of the movie, Boo hands Sully a toy fish in her room. It’s Nemo. Finding Nemo wouldn’t be released for another two years (2003). Im sure this has been found before but my two-year-old spotted this today—I’m home watching her while she’s sick.===In Once upon a time in Hollywood - “Bounty Law” takes place on a set called Melody Ranch. It’s the same set used on Tarantino’s “Django Unchained.” - 2019===In Kung Fu Panda (2008), there is a wall where Po throws ninja stars for target practice. On the wall, there is a picture foreshadowing Kai from Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016).===According to visual effects supervisor Walt Conti, one of the animatronic dummies used during the filming of Free Willy (1993) was so realistic that Keiko became sexually aroused by it===The Art of Self Defense (2019) rule #11 “Guns are for the weak.” is an obvious addition to the original rules, after the grandmaster was killed with a shotgun.===In Robocop (1987), because production scouts considered Detroit not futuristic enough, production took place in Dallas, where temperatures regularly exceed 100°. Peter Weller could lose 8 pounds in a day. He spent much of his time hydrating between takes with air hoses stuffed into his Robocop suit.===Screenslaver's cage of lights that hypnotize Elastigirl in Incredibles 2 (2018) was inspired by an LED curtain projecting video through a web of tiny LED lights, found by the production designer. Set designers then reproduced the effect of projecting graphics through light bulbs.===For the TV version of the NC-17 film Showgirls (1995), censors decided to animate terrible CGI bras on the female characters, whenever they were nude. One scene required the main female character to be entirely CGI, when she beats up a guy topless.===At the end of Frozen 2 (2019) the reindeer Sven has shed the velvet from his antlers. Top picture from beginning of film, bottom picture from the end.===In Godzilla (2014), the opening titles are meant to look like military documents being censored. Nearly every credit has a joke by the producers that is briefly visible before being whited-out.===In The Thing (1982), the title effects sequence was made using an animation cell with \"The Thing\" written on it placed behind a smoke filled fish tank which was then covered with a plastic garbage bag. The burning effect was created once the bag ingited.===In Armageddon (1998), Michael Bay pretends to be working at NASA.===In The Big Lebowski (1998), Franz's girlfriend orders \"pfannkuchen\" – which is German for \"pancakes\" and very similar to Bunny Lebowski's birth name \"Fawn Knutsen\".===In Parasite (2019), the eliteness of ram-don (짜파구리) is represented not by the sirloin, but rather that the Parks combined two highly popular noodles that a vast majority of Koreans would consume separately, and never mix together. That's why Mrs. Kim had never heard of such a simple dish before.===In Jojo Rabbit (2019) the imaginary Hitler is wearing a Native American headdress. Adolf Hitler was a fan of German writer Karl May who wrote about the American west and an Apache named Winnetou. Also, one of the Germans in Inglorious Basterds (2009) has Winnetou on his card in the Who Am I game.===After chasing the killer out of the hospital, the 1968 Charger is seen parked outside. It will be the car that Bullitt (1968) will later chase.===Both Children of Men ('06) and 28 Weeks later ('07) make use of the same Farmhouse.===When Luv kills the lieutenant in Blade Runner 2049, she cuts the lieutenant in the same way that Wallace kills the newly-born replicant—a horizontal slice across the lower abdomen. She does it this way because she has seen it be done this way.===Question about the space jockey in Alien (1979)===In Shrek 2 (2004), during the performance of \"I Need a Hero,\" the Fairy Godmother asks the pianist to \"put it in C minor.\" The actual song is then played in G minor. However, in classical music, C minor is often used to represent \"the heroic struggle.\"",

Its diet is dominated by fruit, in particular figs. It has also adapted well to human-modified habitats such as farmland, cities and parks.===The Marbled polecat is a type of creature found in Asia and Southwestern Europe. It has a long, bushy tail and a striped face. Unfortunately, this species is listed as vulnerable and its numbers are slowly declining.===The Venus flytrap sea anemone (Actinoscyphia aurelia) is a large sea anemone that resembles the more well-known terrestrial Venus flytrap.

It is a deep ocean species, and it feeds on food particles as they drift by in ocean currents.===Quetzals, a small bird known for its magnificently colored feathers, played a large part in Aztec culture and was said to be the inspiration behind a mythical draconic creature called the Quetzalcoatl. The Quetzalcoatl was a serpentine, feathered reptile that was said to be the god of intelligence.===Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) are an endangered species of Old World vulture that has been observed using tools. They will throw rocks at large, thick-shelled eggs of other species to crack them open, and can walk hundreds of meters away from an egg to find a suitable rock.===The males of peacock spiders often display colorful and sometimes iridescent patterns on the upper surface of the abdomen, enhanced with lateral flaps or bristles, either during courtship or the ritualized contests between males which can be complex, involving visual and vibratory signals.===Feather stars are marine animals related to starfish and sea urchins that have a plant-like appearance yet are able to swim with their undulating frond-like tentacles while they gather food and move around. Over 600 species of feather stars have been identified and they are found in all oceans.===Great white sharks can swim at speeds of over 56 km per hour (35 mph),and can swim to depths of 1,200 m (3,900 ft).===The Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) is native to the estuaries of the Bay of Bengal and Southeast Asia and is nearly extinct.

The larvae undergo five instars prior to adulthood whereupon they no longer feed.===The Thylacine, or Tasmanian Tiger, was the largest carnivorous marsupial until it's extinction in 1936. Can you believe these guys had pouches?===The spotted white porcelain anemone crab has highly unusual seafan-shaped claws which it uses to filter the water while sitting on top of an anemone by first collecting mucus from its host anemone's tentacles and then using that to attract and gather small sea creatures and plankton for food.===The Indian Bullfrog male, during the monsoon mating season, turns from drab green to yellow in color and their vocal sacks turn blue. Their loud bellows and changed appearance are key in attracting females. These frogs are able to jump right out of water as though on land despite their huge size.===The bi-color parrotfish (Cetoscarus bicolor), found only in the Red Sea, is among the largest of parrotfishes growing to about 50 cm in length. Interestingly, it is a sequential hermaphrodite, starting first as a dark brown female and then changing to either a brightly colored male or female.===Stomphia coccinea is a small reddish or pinkish sea anemone that has the remarkable ability to detach itself and swim away from predators when necessary. In the gif, when the starfish's sensory organs touched the sea anemone, it rocked back and forth prying itself from its anchorage and escaped.===The slingjaw wrasse (Epibulus insidiator) is native to tropical waters of the Indo-Pacfiic. The most notable feature of sling-jaw wrasses is that the mouths of these fish are armed with highly protrusible jaws which unfold into a tube about half its body length and increase its striking distance.===When the aardwolf smells termites or hears the rustle of thousands of them in the grass with its sensitive pointed ears, it laps them up with its sticky tongue.===A baby porcupine is called a porcupette and (for some strange reason) when they are born their quills are soft.

(Viral feeding time video in comments.)===The turquoise-browed motmot (Eumomota superciliosa) is a colorful bird found in open habitats along the edges of forests extending from the Yucatán Peninsula to Costa Rica. They often perch on fences and posts scanning the fields for insects. It is the national bird of El Salvador and Nicaragua.===The rainbow grasshopper (Dactylotum bicolor) is native to the United States, Canada and northern Mexico.

They use a antifreeze like chemical to help protect them.===The colorful oriental dwarf kingfisher (Ceyx erithaca) is endemic across much of the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia and is found along small streams in densely shaded forests.
