You don't know what that one thing is, though, and you're getting increasingly paranoid as the years go on.===[WP] Alien life was discovered centuries ago and though they are advance they live relatively short lives (25-35 years). You ask your alien friend why he thinks humans live so long. He laughs and says it's because humans run at half power. You laugh back but he stops and says \"No you really do.\"===[WP] You're shopping for superpowers in the discount bin.===[WP] A witch offers a dying female spy reincarnations, but the more she is reincarnated, the less of her original memories she has. Years later, a 10-year-old schoolgirl in full uniform is shocked to discover photos of a WWII spy that looked a lot like her. She even had the same name.===[WP] \"Begone you foul demon cotton eyed Joe, thy grasp on this plane faded long ago; From whence you came, there you shall go. I seal thee away, cotton eyed Joe.\"===[WP] You find weird carvings in your doorframe after letting a hitchhiker stay at your place overnight. The following days strange men in suits show up and ask for the hitchhiker. For whatever reason it seems that they can't enter your house.===[WP] \"I demand to see the manager\" you inform the employee. At first the worker scoffs, but their expression soon changes when you pull out your badge. \"I'm with the Kidnapped And Rescued Employee Network.\" The person sighs loudly, before returning to you quietly- \"Thank you ma'am, right this way.\"===[WP] A vampire training to be fully immortal by exposing himself to his weaknesses in small quantities.===[WP] As an ancient vampire you finally decided to retire to the suburbs and get away from it all. However, your neighbor so happens to be a retired legendary vampire hunter. Tensions are high at first but over the years a friendship starts to form.===[WP] Turns out, God used most of their power creating the universe. What remains does nothing more than keep them alive. God is left to make the world a better place, at least as much as one immortal \"human\" can.===[WP] In 6078, Earth became 100% water and all the land sunk. 100 years later, humans live on huge ships and search for land. You and your crew finally find a small island but as you explore it, the island seems to be growing bigger.===[WP] Well, we were right...and wrong. Visitors from outer space were indeed looking for “intelligent life” here on Earth. But it wasn’t us. In fact, humanity didn’t even make their top ten.===[WP] This is it, the war to end all wars has finally broken out... and subsequently, all those ancient heroes who are said to arise in their homelands' times of need simultaneously awaken.===[WP] Crack out the Mimosas and Ambrosia - it's Ladies' Board-Game Night at Olympus! And this time, Thaleia, Psyche, and Eris are excited to present a project they've been working on together - Cards Against Divinity.===[WP] After a long and arduous adventure, you stand before the Villain atop his throne. \"You have finally arrived,\" he says, \"Now get on my knee.\" \"Did you mean 'get on your knees'?\" \"No.\"===[WP]: As a side-effect, a new healing spell heals wounds of the mind as well as the body. The amount of wandering adventurers nosedives, as people with the means to properly process their traumas don’t tend to go around risking their lives killing dragons.===[WP] You did it. After all these years, you finally caught the red dot, and became a hero to cats everywhere. However, in so doing, you broke the laws of physics, and now all the smart adults are worried, especially yours, a very smart one in particular (for a human).===[WP] The International Space Station intercepts a foreign communication from deep space that, when decrypted, reveals that the Solar System around Earth has been deemed a sanctuary because we are one of the last uncontacted species in the Milky Way Galaxy.===[WP] The aliens have invaded. You are in the Air Force, and you are sent out into the skies to combat the extraterrestrials. However, before you even fire a shot, one of the spaceships are shot down. You look behind you to see a crimson red plane, piloted by Manfred von Richthofen; the Red Baron.===[WP] Radical genetic engineering has allowed humans to adapt to worlds normally too radioactive, toxic, hot, cold, high/low gravity or high/low pressure to be inhabited, basically redefining what it means for a world to be habitable. The aliens aren't sure whether to be fascinated or disturbed.===[WP] On your first day as a sewer worker your boss hands you a shotgun and says “what you thought drain covers were actually meant to keep things from falling in?” Your coworkers look grim as they apply their camo paint===[WP] To find a way of avoiding the looming Apocalypse, humanity builds an exact simulation of the world. However, instead of figuring out a solution themselves, \"simulated humanity\" creates a simulation for that purpose as well. As this continues recursively, you start questioning your own reality.===[WP] The self-driving cars and trucks maintained a steady flow of traffic. Subways ran on time, and drones zipped over pristine streets. Keeping it all running kept me busy, and made it feel like the city I remembered. Honestly, it wasn't a bad way to cope with being the last person alive on Earth.===[WP] A warrior in training finally unlocks his magic: Darkness. He really wants to be a hero, but darkness is used a lot by evil. One day, he finds a sage that takes him on a spiritual journey to discover the goodness in darkness, and how to fight the ultimate evil that uses light.",
