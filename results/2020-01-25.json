Freeze overnight. Eat fresh out of the freezer and thank me later.

Bring it in close, smack that hand on their back and let them know you're pleased to see them.===LPT: When cooking scrambled eggs, season your eggs once the eggs have begun to curdle. Putting salt in the eggs before this point will cause the finished product to be a lot more watery.===LPT: Before you get in that hot tub, be sure to check the filter first.

Hold it then right click. That way you don't have to go through the process of the app loading then closing it.===LPT: In order to avoid startling somebody if you accidentally \"sneak\" up behind them, just cough.===LPT: Create a dump email for sites or surveys that you don’t want info from. Remember the password in case you need to make confirmation===LPT: Are you an overthinker? In conversation, remember to prioritise responding to the very last thing that was said. Otherwise others can/will feel you are not paying attention.===LPT: On iOS, you can play music (or any video) from the YT website in the background using the “Request Desktop Site” option…===LPT: You should apply warm water instead of cold water to burns.
