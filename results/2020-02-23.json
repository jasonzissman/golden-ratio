It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===Notice: As of 2/10/2020, we are requiring sources (in comments) for trivial details.===For Toy Story (1995), the screenwriters taped shoes to a wooden board to help the creative team figure out how the army soldiers would walk and run.===In Lilo &amp; Stitch (2002) before the characters even meet, they both bite Mertle and Gantu, respectively. The bites and the response from the characters work to show how Lilo and Stitch parallel each other, and that others view them as freaks/dangerous/unclean (leading to infection).===For Mad Max (1979), director George Miller worked as an ER doctor to help finance the film. Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) is named after physician Carl von Rokitansky, who created the Rokitansky procedure, a method for removing organs during autopsy. To save money, Miller paid much his crew in beer.===In Disney's CINDERELLA and ALICE IN WONDERLAND, the same actress played the Fairy Godmother and the Red Queen in both the original animation and the live-action remake: Verna Felton voiced both women in the originals (1950, 1951), while Helena B. Carter played both women in the remakes (2010, 2015)===In John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (2019) Keanu repeats the iconic quote from The Matrix (1999). \"Guns. Lots of Guns.\"===In A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), the effect of blood rushing to the ceiling during Glen's (Johnny Depp) demise was achieved using an upside down set. It was actually spilling onto the floor. Director Wes Craven and DP Jacques Haitkin captured the scene strapped to the wall in race car seats.===In the opening of Coraline (2009), the spinning wheel is covered in spider webs, hinting at both the Beldam's true form and the fact that it's been years since she last kidnapped someone (Wyborn's great-aunt).===In \"Skyfall\" (2012), the Aston Martin DB5 that is destroyed during the final fight was one of the three 1/3 scale models specially built for the film. The effect was achieved through forced perspectives and superimposing the model onto the actual car during the earlier gunfight scene.===Casino Royale (2006). Bond tips the dealer $500,000.00===In Zootopia (2016) A pig resembling the scrapped villain ‚ÄúMayor Swinton‚Äù makes a brief appearance during the DMV scene. In early movie drafts she held the role of both Lionheart and Bellwether===For \"The Pianist\" (2002), Adrien Brody lost 30 pounds to play Szpilman, eating just two boiled eggs for breakfast, a little chicken for lunch, and a small amount of fish or chicken with steamed vegetables for dinner over a six-week period. At his lightest he weighted just 130 pounds===In \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992), Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) remarks that one of the criminals is 'dead as Dillinger'. Tierney had famously portrayed Dillinger in his first major film role decades earlier.===In Evan Almighty (2007), Morgan Freeman (who acts as God), appears as a waiter. His name tag reads ‚ÄúAl Mighty‚Äù===In Monsters Vs. Aliens (2009), when the U.S. military launches an air strike, one of the missiles reads: ‚ÄúE.T. go home‚Äù. During that brief scene, a sped up version of the original main theme of E.T. (1982) composed by John Williams can be heard.===In John Wick (2014), to get Daisy to wake John up, they had to smear bacon grease onto Keanu's face so the puppy would lick him.===In The Empire Strikes Back (1980) the actor who play the imperial officer would be dragging Leia away in cloud city was a no show. So the actor who played Boba Fett, Jeremy Bulloch, put on the costume and did the part.===This is Scorsese during a scene in Gangs of New York (2002). I think it's pretty cool that he made a small appearance in the movie. I hope others notice it as well. Nice cameo form one of the best directors of all time.===In Little Shop of Horrors (1986), Audrey has a stuffed dog in her apartment, which is the same breed as the one she imagines while singing \"Somewhere That's Green.\"===In Superbad (2007) Micheal Cara is said to look like somebody‚Äôs brother. Later in the movie, the first party the two go to, a coked out guy mistakes him for the same guys brother===In How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) to get Max into the right mindset to be a reindeer, Jim Carrey behaves like a film director trying to influence an actor to fit the part. Carrey decided to imitate the nearby director (even using his hat). Ron Howard liked it so much he left it in the film.===In Fight Club (1999) When the narrator speaks with Marla, the phone has paint stains and a smiley face sticker next to it. Later in the film members of project Mayhem paint a smiley face on a building.===In Transformers (2007) the Decepticon disguised as a cop car has \"to punish and enslave..\". Always a fun catch===In WALL-E (2008), the musical WALL-E is watching is Hello Dolly! (1964). WALL-E also featured several songs from the musical (\"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\" and \"It Only Takes a Moment\").===The actor in Hot Fuzz (2097) kept forgetting his line so they let him use his real birthday. Happy Birthday, Underage Drinker #1===In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Yondu is buried with a trinket that looks like him.",

And, they're also super cute when they're tiny, don't you think?===Macropinna microstoma or barreleye is a rather bizarre deep-water fish with a transparent fluid-filled head and tubular eyes located well inside the head and capped by bright green lenses which collect light. The two spots above the fish's mouth are not eyes; they are olfactory organs called nares.===Manatees make a number of different sounds, most of them can only be heard underwater &amp; sound like squeaks===The koala is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia.
