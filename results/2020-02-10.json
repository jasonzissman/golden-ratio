Get it in writing.===LPT: Go to Funerals. You'll be a better person.===LPT: keep your travel passport and other important documents in a ziplock bag when travelling to avoid liquid damage such as ink, coffee and rain===LPT: Opt out of junkmail===LPT: Respectfully decline to answer a hiring manager's question about how much you were paid in your last job. Do job market research and based on your experience and skills, give them a high price if possible. Or else they will only offer you a maximum of 10k more $$$ than you were making before.===LPT: Avoid feeling bad about procrastinating by planning ahead of time to do it at the last moment.===LPT: If Windows 10 is telling you that it's going to restart to apply updates and you are worried about losing something you are in the middle of, open up notepad and type in random gibberish and don't save. When Windows tries to reboot, it will be stopped by Notepad's save dialog.===LPT: If you have a metal water bottle/flask that has a dent on it, fill it with water and put it in the freezer for a few hours. The expansion should pop the dent out.===LPT: If you find an item you want to buy on an online store, add it to cart and close the website. You will likely get an Abandoned Cart notification within a few hours that will offer you a 10-15% discount for returning and completing the purchase on an item you already intended to buy.===LPT: If you notice your blinker sound in your car suddenly ticking and blinking on the dash faster, chances are one of your blinker lights is burned out===LPT: It's counter-intuitive, but sometimes the best way to achieve one big goal is to have two big goals.===LPT: When buying a used car, check if there are any locking lugnuts on the wheels. If there are, make sure you are given the key to the locks, otherwise there is usually a labor fee to remove them without the key.===LPT: Frist time out on your own.

It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2019.===Notice: As of 2/10/2020, we are requiring sources (in comments) for trivial details.===Knives Out (2019) had many closeups of characters with eyeglasses, so the production cleverly sculpted mattes to reshape lighting equipment into scenery you'd realistically expect to see reflected in the glasses.===In Knives Out (2019), the portrait of the deceased has a subtle change after the murder has been solved... a smirk.===In Ocean's Twelve (2004) the character Tess, played by Julia Roberts, is forced to pretend to be Julia Roberts and has to act like Roberts to Roberts' friends. In the credits, the character Tess is credited for her portrayal.===In Highlander (1986) Clancy Brown (The Kurgen) improvised using the lines \"I have something to say. It's better to burn out, than fade away.\"===In “The Big Short” (2015) Christian Bale took a two week crash course on drumming to actually play the drums to Pantera’s “By Demons Be Driven.” To prepare for the scene he listened to nothing but Pantera and Mastodon. He insisted on performing the double bass parts with an injured knee.===At the end of Captain America: Civil War (2016), Vision is seen contemplating the role he played in the “catastrophe” he had predicted. He is holding a Rook, the only chess piece that represents a thing instead of a person.===In Toy Story 3 (2010), one of Bonnie's treasured toys was a Totoro plushie; showcasing a cool collaboration between Disney, Pixar, and Studio Ghibli.===In Baseketball (1998) the spots to shoot a triple are tilted because when the game was being developed on driveways a triple would be shot on the driveway approach which typically has an incline===In the closing scene of Sister Act (1992) where Dolores and the nuns perform for the Pope, in the background you can clearly make out Jake &amp; Elwood from The Blues Brothers (1982) watching the show.===In Avengers: infinity war (2018) Thanos has shaved hair and beard which means he is not bald naturally unlike most people think.===In Ford Vs Ferrari (2019), Christian Bale went to Bondurant High Performance Driving School in Arizona to prepare for his role as Ken Miles. For the scenes when Ken is hopping in and out of the GT40 in the pits, that is actually Christian!===In Catch Me If You Can (2002), while flying back to the US Leo's character looks out the window and says \"That's La Guardia, runway 44\". Runways are only numbered 01-36, showing his true lack of aviation knowledge since he was never in fact a pilot.===In Toy Story 4 (2019) you can see the pizza planet truck tattooed on the carnival employee’s leg===The Great Dictator (1940): All signs in the background are in Esperanto. This was a jab at Hitler's belief that Esperanto was a Jewish plot to subvert German culture by creating an international language.===Apocalypto (2006) An image of Waldo lying among dead bodies flashes.===In Erin Brockovich (2000) the real Erin Brockovich makes a short appearance as a waitress in a diner. Her name badge says ‘Julia’ as Julia Roberts plays Erin in the movie.===In Mission Impossible: Ghost protocol (2011), Ethan Hunt uses the code \"Alpha 113\" AKA \"A113\", the number that is used as an easter egg in Pixar movies. This is because the director, Brad Bird, directed The Incredibles (2004), Rottatoille (2007) and The Incredibles 2 (2018), all pixar movies.===In Princess Mononoke (1997), Lady Eboshi wears red lipstick, making her one of the few Studio Ghibli characters with visible lips.===In Finding Nemo (2003), Gill is a moorish idol. This species is known to not handle captivity well, so him being the one who constantly comes up with escape plans makes sense.===The Other Guys (2010) A man on the street says Mark and someone is recording them in the background.===In Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) the secret USS Vengeance warship which was discovered by Scotty, had its model in display at Admiral Marcus' table earlier in the film.===In Forrest Gump (1994) lieutenant Dan shows to Forrest's wedding walking with his \"new legs\" followed by his wife, a vietnamese woman. This shows he finally came to terms with his past in Vietnam and losing his legs during the war.===In The Emperor's New Groove (2000), when Kuzco fires Yzma, he gives her a pink slip.===Tron (1982) we can clearly see Pacman game being played on the right-hand side of the screen. Hilarious enough, it really fits into the structure of the movie, because it’s a game right?===In Knives Out (2019) when Ransom and Marta are at the bar, the song “Sundown” by Gordon Lightfoot is playing, written about groupie Cathy Smith who infamously killed John Belushi by administering a fatal dose of heroin",

However, being members of Feliformia, they are more closely related to cats than dogs. Instead of a pup, the young hyena pictured here is called a cub.===The bearded reedling (Panurus biarmicus) is a small roundish bird native to Europe and Asia with the single largest population of around 500 nesting pairs residing in the marshy reed beds along the Tay River in Great Britain where they stay year round.===The Eurasian sparrowhawk is migratory in the north of its range, with these birds wintering in southern Europe, southern Asia and less commonly in Africa.===The red-crested turaco (Tauraco erythrolophus), the national bird of Angola, is one of the more colorful birds in its genus, and its call sounds somewhat like a jungle monkey. Turacos are found in large flocks and feed on ripe fruits. Interestingly, all flock members help new moms with \"childcare.\"===Incubator birds are Australian fowl that are quite unique - while all other birds use their body heat to incubate their eggs, incubator birds pile plant debris on their eggs and make use of the heat of composting to hatch their eggs. The bird periodically monitors the temperature of the mound.===Southern Flying Squirrels can rotate up to 180 degrees mid-flight. They can manipulate their \"wings\" depending on if they want to travel quickly/ long distances or simply \"parachute\" down. parts of their gliding seemingly defy physics. They may also use echolocation and they glow pink in blacklight.===This is the Ili pika, an endangered animal native to Northwestern China. It has only been seen a few times, and there are estimated to be less of 1000 of them left.===The thorn treehopper (Alchisme grossa) is one of the most attentive of all insect parents. She will fiercely defend her offspring until they are fully grown using her thorn-shaped headdress as a shield and intimidation tool. This insect is found in abundance in the rain cloud forests of Bolivia.===Clownfish like Nemo are in the family Anemonefish that includes about thirty other species. When the lone female in a group of Anemonefish dies, the biggest male (the only one that was breeding) becomes a female and resumes reproduction - now with the new largest male.===The cougar (Puma concolor) is native to the Americas and has the widest range of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere which accounts for all its other names: puma, mountain lion, red tiger and catamount. Its range extends from Canada to the southern regions of South America.===The muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), the only species in genus Ondatra, is a medium-sized semi-aquatic rodent native to North America and is found in wetlands over a wide range of climates and habitats. Muskrats mate while underwater and can also hold their breaths for up to 20 minutes underwater.===The point colouration typical of Siamese cats is a form of partial albinism and is caused by an enzyme involved with producing colour pigment that is heat sensitive and only functions in a cool environment. (More details in comments)===The Arabian sand boa's eyes are small and located on the top of its head. It hides below the surface of the sand with its eyes projecting out in order to ambush prey.===Parrotfish help create most of the the beautiful white sand beaches often found near coral reefs, like in Hawaii. They eat pieces of dead coral that are covered in algae, digest the algae, and then poop out the broken down coral which becomes the white sand===The Eurasian hoopoe (Upupa epops) is the most widespread species of the genus Upupa, native to Europe, Asia and the northern half of Africa. Interestingly, the hoopoe flies more like a butterfly than a bird with its rounded wings closing only halfway in flight. It is the national bird of Israel.===The Cuban tody (Todus multicolor) is a bird species in the family Todidae that is found in Cuba and adjacent islands. This species nests in holes burrowed in clay embankments, occasionally in a rotten tree trunk or even at the entrance to limestone caves. They are most often seen in pairs.===Spring Peepers are a relatively small frog that actually freeze solid each winter, just like Wood Frogs and a number of other amphibians. They make loads of sugar and pump it around their bodies where it works as an antifreeze - preventing ice crystals from forming and stabbing their cells===When Dung Beetles spot soft soil, they stop and bury the ball, then mate underground. After the mating, one or both of them prepares the brooding ball. When the ball is finished, the female lays eggs inside it, a form of mass provisioning.===This handsome arachnid is either a mature male pamphobeteus platyomma (Brazilian pink bloom tarantula) or mature male pamphobeteus machala (Purple bloom tarantula). This genus includes some of the largest tarantulas in the world, and they are capable of eating small birds, reptiles and mammals.===The Barn Owl (Tyto alba) has excellent low-light vision and extremely quiet flight, and can easily find prey at night by sight, however, its ability to locate prey by sound alone is the best of any owl species that scientists have tested. The North American subspecies of barn owl is the largest.===Meet Sarada, a large fan-throated lizard only found in India. Discovered in 2016, its dewlap extends along 59% of its trunk having colors yellow, iridescent blue, black and orange. It is the sister genus of Sitana and is only found in 2 Indian states - Maharashtra and Karnataka.===The Guianan Rupicola rupicola is found in tropical mountainous regions of the northeastern part of South America.
