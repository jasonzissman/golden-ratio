# Golden Ratio

This is a simple project meant to determine which subreddits have the highest guild-to-subscriber ratio.

To compute this ratio, we take (number of Gilds) / (number of subscribers x 10,000,000).

In human-readable form, this equates to number of guilds per 10,000,000 subscribers. The higher the number, the more gildings we see in relation to the subreddit's size.
